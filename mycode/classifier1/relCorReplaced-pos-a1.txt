If that one doesn't work either, then I'll know that it is a flaw in the design of this model, but if it does, I'll add a comment to this review and maybe upgrade the rating from 3 to 5.------------------After having bought the same unit at a local store, I can affirm that it works fine.
Apparently the first one just had some electronic flaw.
I prefer the Melitta brand and others like it, because you can use the cone-shaped Melitta filters in them, which in my opinion produce much better coffee than the flat Mr. Coffee style filters.
Great Coffe maker
My husband is thrilled i bought Coffe maker for him.
Easy to use
Easy and less messy than our previous coffee maker.I particularly like the feature of the 3 strength settings
DeLongi maker works like a champ
Love DeLongi maker.
Solidly built product.
I have had the coffeemaker for over a month and I am very pleased.
I have had no problems with the hot water side.
Very convenient and the water is very hot with no bad taste.
I especially like the carafe warming plate.
I keep the setting on low and it keeps the coffee plenty hot without affecting the taste.
Not necessary with this machine.
I would recommend this machine without any reservations.
coffee lovers machine
This is by far the best coffee maker we ever owned its a little more expensive but its worth it.It doesn,t have a swing out filter holder like the others i used thus eliminating the sagging  basket.I recommend using a paper filter in the gold tone filter as it makes disposal a little easier.The self cleaning feature and reminder are very helpful.I highly recommend this coffee maker to everyone, happy brewing!
It's hard to believe that one coffeemaker could elicit so many gushing positives and at the same time be lambasted for poor design/engineering.
Well, I made the leap and bought one last night, having just returned a new, fully-programmable, stainless steel,upper-end Mr. Coffee that functioned perfectly as a machine but maybe the taste of the coffee was a little plasticky.
After reading the Cuisinart reviews, I felt it as a bit of a gamble to acquire more expensive, suspect machinery for the potential return of better tasting coffee.
But the investment has totally paid off, at least in taste.
The Cuisinart truly produces a warmer and much smoother cup of coffee than the upper-end Mr. Coffee, using the same pre-ground Folgers Custom Grind from Walmart, a finer than average grind.
It is a notable difference, and I guess there is more to brewing coffee than just showering grounds with hot water.Perhaps Cuisinart has made improvements to the product over time,because the unit functions fine and cleans easily, though how it holds up over time remains to be seen.And now, retailers have just cut the base price from $99.99 to $79.99, and with a 20% off Bed,Bath & Beyond coupon, we're talking about a $64 dollar machine that looks great and brews a rich, smooth cup of coffee.
need to quit being so...retentive and appreciate the larger picture of a better cup of coffee.
It is nice that it is stainless steel and has options for brewing regular, bold or strong coffee.
Great espresso machine with a few cons
I bought this espresso machine a little bit over 2 years ago, it has not given me any problems yet.
I have been using Durgol Swiss Espresso Special Decalcifier, 2-Pack 4.2 fluid ounce Bottles, which does a great job and is relatively inexpensive, compared to the brand names.Pros:1) It is a low maintenance machine, the only thing you need to do is clean it.2) Easy to make coffee, cappuccino and espresso: just press a button and it's ready (unless you are making cappuccino, then using the steaming wand, it takes you less than 30 seconds)3) The decalcifying process is also easy.
It takes 30 minutes to complete.Cons:1) To make relatively strong coffee you need to keep the settings on extra strong coffee and grind the beans very fine (there is a setting for that on the grinder)2) Coffee comes out warm-hot, but not very hot, so if you plan to add milk from the refrigerator, warm it in the microwave3) Espresso is not really that strong, compared to Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts, even on the highest settingOverall, I would highly recommend this espresso machine to people who want something fancier than a regular coffee maker or Keurig, but also want to keep it simple from the point of putting an effort to make a cup of coffee.Feel free to ask any questions.
Good coffee at 1/10 of Starbucks price
This is a nice entry-level Espresso machine.
15-bar of steam pressure is on the low end, but the result tastes good enough for me.It is easy to use and clean it.
It may not compare to gourmet espresso, but definitely tastes and smells much much better than regular brewed coffee.
Great Coffemaker
I liked that there was an option when you're brewing fewer than 5 cups of coffee and that you could adjust the heat for the coffee carafe.The unit was easy to program and my coffee has tasted great.
The gold filter is good, but I don't like ANY sediment in my coffee, so we double up with coffee filters which actually makes things a lot easier to clean.
It's a little awkward to pour in the water and crane your head around to look at the water level which is toward the back of the unit, but I love that it comes with a charcoal filter to keep my coffee tasting good.The hot water side has been pretty convenient when I have company over that prefers tea or when I have a nostalgic craving for instant noodles.
It doesn't take long at all for the water to heat.
I definitely appreciate the "coffee's done" alarm.
Nice coffee maker
They are still using it 4 years later and seem to enjoy it.
It works fairly simply.
great product
This coffee maker is simple to use and makes great coffee time after time.
Using a burr grinder on the course setting seems to make the most flavorful coffee that is never bitter.
I would definitely recommend this product.
the foam is pretty good but you've got to dispense the first couple seconds or you'll shoot hot nasty water into your cup.
I love several features.
This machine allows you to set the number of hours the pot stays on, control the heater plate and has a very comfortable design for the carafe itself.
The temperature of the coffee is the best part.
It's the perfect temperature every time.The machine beeps when the coffee is ready.
The design is attractive.
Love the the singer serve.
Nice hot coffee but the next time I went to make a pot the water wouldn't come out.
Too bad because a I love the piping hot coffee from the singer serve side.
This sucker makes the best coffee
I bought this over a year ago, and it is still making perfect coffee every morning.
I recommend this for anyone who wants to invest a little money in an amazing coffee maker.
My favorite feature is the temperature settings.
You can start taking big drinks on the low heat setting, but the coffee is still nice and hot.
Love this machine!
The product functioned well and does not have any quality problems.
Shipping time was less than estimated.
Happy with the product and service.
This machine makes very good espressos and capuccinos.
Great coffee easy to use
I, like many, got tired of paying the expensive price of K-Cups and wanted a simple one cup brewer.
It makes a great cup of coffee.
Better than the Kurig.
In my opinion the Scoop wins, and with the easy of use and  the price of the device and the cost of making coffee my Keurig is about to go on e Bay.
Great maker for the price
This is a great coffee maker for someone looking to spend under $100.
This maker is easy to use and easy to clean.2.
The carafe is excellent and keeps coffee piping hot for two hours; it is still hot enough to drink without microwaving four hours later.4.
The design ensures that the coffee never sees the light of day as it is brewing, so your coffee remains hot.5.
I'm not sure what temperature this brews at, but it seems to be hotter than other machines I've tried in the price range.In all, this is a good coffee maker for the price.
Much less expensive to use than Kurig
Good cup of coffee.
Nice to be able to use the coffee of your choice and not have to purchase the expensive Kcups.
Why not just make a lid that closes and seals without having to push it down and snap it?I'm sure all these things except for the first make it a technically great tasting cup of coffee, but for me, the average Jane, just wanting a quick cup of joe... it's a few too many steps for me to enjoy fully.Maybe I'm just too cranky before I get my first cup?
I have to admit, it makes a flavorful cup o' joe and I always get compliments from family & friends.TIP on CLEANING:  The only way to get the stainless caraf like new is to put a TEASPOON of automatic dishwasher soap and fill the caraf with hot water.
If it had lasted longer I would have rated it higher.
I was very happy with my purchase.
Thank you so much for your quality service.
I'll start by saying the Keurig B60 makes a phenomenal cup of coffee.
great buy
this is a great buy i love the features and easy to use we have hard water so i love that it has a water filter.
best coffe pot i have had
The best product ever received
My husband got this for me for our Anniversary and I just love it.
This automatic latte maker is so easy to use that Starbucks is going to loose a lot of my business.
You just put a few tablespoons of reg coffee , add water and milk, add your favorite coffee syrup(sold at most grocery stores today, and Target sells Starbucks syrup) it takes about a minute and voila , you have a great latte.
Great coffemaker for the price
I love this coffeemaker.
I don't use the cappacino portion too often, but I like having only one machine on my counter instead of a coffemaker AND a cappacino machine.
This is a very nice product.
shipped fast,works great
got order faster than expected, was packaged well.
It also included a carbon filter, but best of all you can make anywhere between 4 and 12 cups - much more flexibility.Amazon was GREAT as usual, they took it back and issued a refund before I even shipped it back.
One of the Best Super Automatics Out There for the Price
These machines are the best in class for price and performance, produce a great espresso, and are maintainable in ways that other manufacturers models are not.
The coffee from the Delonghi is just as good as from Jura and even some manual models such as Expobar and Rancillo.
It is very close to what you find in Italy - not quite, but for the price it is worth it.
Great crema, hot temperature, rich flavor.
And the best part is you can pull out the brew mechanism and clean it - VERY key.
This will keep any weird flavors from your tap entering the coffee.
Decent for a decent price
Other than that, it makes great coffee.
A Fine Cup of Coffee
Gets the job done and makes a good cup of coffee.
Great coffee maker!
I love this coffee maker.
It brews good coffee, very quickly.
State of the art it is not!It makes a good cup of coffee, but most drip makers do.
It looks nice and I feel quite posh with my Cuisinart coffee maker on the counter.
All in all, I would not recommend this maker unless you get it for some wonderful deal.ETA that one month later we've broken the carafe.
The glass is thin which keeps the coffee hot but also means easy breaks.
Wow, convenient and good looking
A nice utilitarian addition to the kitchen.
The concept is great, either one cup with traveling mug on one side, can use some pods.
A regular carafe on the other side.The operation is easy, when on, the blue light goes on.
A timer is very useful.
There are many such nice coffee makers in the market.
For around $70, this one with single cup serving appears to be the best.Beware: when ordering.
Why did I hold on to my last (piece of junk) coffee maker so long?
This makes perfect/perfect coffee every time.
It might cost a little more, but the quality of craftsmanship will save me money in the long run, it will last longer.
Timer works perfectly, my device-challenged wife has no trouble with it.
The features are exactly right, not too many, but has the ones needed.
Very Easy to Use with excellent coffee results
I am very pleased with the Cuisinart DCC-1100BK 12-Cup Coffeemaker, which I purchased from Amazon.It is easy to use and program according to my particular needs.
This coffee maker makes very good coffee.
The carafe is a perfect size for two large cups coffee.
If you can handle this it's a good coffee maker.
We are very pleased with this purchase!
We are very pleased with the purchase.Pros:- Hot water dispenser (obvious)- Ensures condensation falls back into reservoir- Very easy controls and programming- Alarm when brewing is complete- Notifies you when it needs more water- You can set the temp and length of time to keep the heating plate active for the coffee potCons:- Does not purchase new coffee grounds when we get low- Does not deliver cups to my office (I actually have to walk over to the pot)
8 years of great coffee
The electronics, setting the timer and what not was easy enough.
Wonderful coffemaker
This coffee maker is simply wonderful.
The coffee it makes is outstanding.
The thermal pot keeps coffee very hot for almost 5 hours with no change in coffee taste.
Would definitely recommend this coffee maker to everyone.
Good Mill & Brew
The machine is simple to use and makes good coffee.
I was a little disappointed that there is no method to select a type of grind but it makes good coffee with the preset.
Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.
Love coffee pot
We love this coffee pot for the different choices it gives you.
It is working well with my husband who just does the single serve in the morning for work.
We are saving on buying coffee cause he is not making a whole pot for 1 cup.
Compared to a My K-Cup, this wins
If you are looking at this product I'm guessing you're like me...trying to save money by making smaller amounts of coffee at a time and totally against the idea of the wasteful expense of a K-cup system.
I think it is safe to say this is a great option for you.The product makes a good cup of coffee.
Compared to a K-cup unit, I think it's actually a more drinkable immediately.Using this unit should save you a lot of money on coffee.
With this unit, I use 2.5 teaspoons of coffee to make about a mug and a half of coffee, none of which gets wasted.
Plus I have found that immediately refilling the water and running it again with the same grounds works great.
So call it 3 mugs of coffee with only 2.5 small scoops of grounds and no waste.
My regular coffee purchases have decreased dramatically since buying this unit.Overall the coffee is flavorful and not weak as long as you use the "bold" setting.
Is a much bolder and smoother brew than your basic Keurig cup.
I use a My K-Cup in a standard Keurig machine at the office, and I like the Hamilton Beach unit's coffee much better.Many reviews here have complained about splattering or messy grounds...all I can say is your mileage may vary and you have to experiment a little for example I found that grocery store bought bags of Seattle's Best work great in this unit, however Gevalia Grounds are too fine and tend to make a mess.
Regardless the unit is really easy to clean.
Made great coffee and was cleaned monthly.
Best Affordable Espresso Machine yet!
I owned an expensive S-Bucks machine and hated it.
This machine pulls perfect shots with beautiful and tasty crema!!
Make sure to buy a PUMP driven machine if you want AUTHENTIC espresso, the others won't cut it!
I'd recommended this as the perfect gift or addition to your home.
Definitely worth the cost!
Makes a wonderful cup of coffee....espresso...cappuccino whatever your fancy is!
While intimidating at first, it is quite easy to use and the milk frother makes a perfect and hot foam!
wonderfull coffee
Very easy to learn to use and the coffee tastes much better than my old drip coffee.
I love that it stays hot all day, I can have the same hot coffee at night as I did in the morning.
No burnt or bitter taste.
I find I can use less sugar or cream since the coffee tastes so much better from this!I'm using my #4 cone filters up with it by tearing a small hole to put through the tube and just folding it down to fit in the basket.
Brews well, Leaks badly, Breaks easily
Semi successful, but a pain.Then there is the carafe breakage issue -- just as others said, the glass is so thin, remarkably so for a coffee carafe.
brews great coffee
Love the timer feature.
Keeps excellent time and makes up to 4 cups of coffee in less than 5 minutes
Makes excellent coffee!
I love this coffeemaker.
Brews coffee plenty hot and the blue light is like a night light in my kitchen.
I think a cone filter makes much better coffee than a basket.
Best bang for the buck! Excellent espresso every time!
I cannot believe that people have problems with this:a) it is only supposed to pull 1 or 2 oz, any more would be weak.
At the end, lightly tamp before pulling the shot.d) The espresso is plenty dark.
If you have a true love for espresso you'll take the extra two minutes to grind your beans immediately before brewing!Overall: This is an EXCELLENT machine for the cost.
I returned a Gaggia machine and am more pleased with this one.
It is compact, does exactly what it is supposed to, and it is paying for itself every day.
I use a separate pitcher - problem solved.To wrap things up -I've had this model about 4 months and it is churning out fresh coffee on a daily basis without fail.
I can recommend this brand/model.
Awesome Coffeepot!
It's nice to have hot water for tea when I don't feel like having coffee, and with four coffee drinkers in the house and company, it is the perfect size.
It brews very fast and knowing when it's done or when it turns off (it beeps) is an added bonus!
It makes great espressos!
This coffee maker is perfect for me, because I only drink 3 cups of coffee in the morning.
I like getting 1 fresh cup of coffee every time.
Satisfied Customer!
The bottom line is it makes a great cup of espresso!
It was the cheapest pump-driven machine I found.
It is smart looking and doesn't take up much space.
It has more plastic parts than I prefer, but it is light weight, which I like.
I use the machine daily; it has been trouble free.
I recommend it without hesitation,
Works Great
For the most part, I love it....The Good:  **I love the program feature--coffee is all made when I wake up.
**I also love the "brew strength" setting.
I like very strong coffee, so this is a great feature.
I does come out at a nice drinking temperature right away though, and like I said earlier, the carafe keeps it warm (not hot) for hours.Overall, I am very satisfied, and would recommend this product to others.
A nice coffee machine
Makes good coffee.
THe fact that the water reservoir and the coffee grounds/filter are separate compartments ensures no cross contamination - which is one reason I picked this unit in the first place.
The water heated very fast, it holds a large capacity of storage water, its filtered.
The idea is alluring - just put in the whole beans, add water, press a button and voila.
the grinder is coated with moist grounds so you have take apart the two-part contraption and wash it and there are plenty of nooks and crannies to clean...you have to do this each time you use the machine.About a third of the time that you use the machine, you'll have a flood.There's a design flaw when you pour in the water, some it flies out the back of one of the vent holes and onto the floor so you have to tilt the machine forward with one hand while adding water with the other.Regardless of the bean/water ratio, the coffee is weak.Thermal carafes are fine but the coffee has to be hot from the get-go.
Pros: Have enjoyed this coffee maker from the first day.
We looked at many different Carafe models but could not find one as nice as this.
Coffee stays fresh and hot in the Carafe.
Good Knives for the Money
These are nice knives for a 70$ knife set, but they wouldn't be worth much more than that.
Eventually I'll upgrade to a high end set of Henckel or Wustof knives, but for now these knives will serve fine.
I seriously LOVE these knives.
I shopped online a while to find a good set that is not too expensive and these are great!
When I compared them to the ones I'm giving away the quality is unbeatable.
They are thick and very sharp not to mention they look great on my counter!
I STILL gave this set 5 stars because they really are good.
Love these knives
Hold an edge well and I personally like that they are not so heavy.
Better than my ja Henckels
I have a set of ja henkel knives I got from Costco years ago that I thought were good.
Needless to say the Henckels got wrapped up and these stayed at home.Great weight and sharp, feel sturdy and comfortable in your hand.
I cook and cut constantly and these babies are good.
I have some very good knives but can definitely see these getting a lot of use.Anyone who says these are not sharp enough are insane.
Unless u need a surgeons scalpel these will be plenty sharp enough to cut any food.
I simply returned that set and recieved a great set in the mail a few days later.
Great forks, decent spoons, sharp knives
To that end: the forks are perfect!
My kiddo now enjoys eating with one because she's not frustrated by an ineffective plastic utensil.
Great knives
So far the knives have worked great, no complaints thus far.
There are extremely sharp and comfortable to use.
Having the option to sharpen is also a plus.
A Decent Set of Knives
The knives are sharp, and I like the built in sharpener.
Aside from that they work well.
OK , BETTER THAN THE ONES WITH SKINNY HANDLES
THEY FIT YOUR HAND BETTER THAN SKINNY HANDLES , SO YOU CAN USE THEM WITHOUT HURTING YOUR HAND.
THE OVERALL SIZE IS A MITE BIGGER , BUT THATS OK , THAT WAY I CAN SHOVEL IT IN FASTER , THEY ARE STRONG SO THEY DON'T BEND AROUND.
THERE ARE MUCH BETTER ONES OUT THERE , IF YOU WANT TO PAY MORE , BUT FOR THE PRICE THESE ARE JUST FINE.
Fabulous value for everyday use
This flatware is heavy duty, yet looks elegant.
It feels great in your hand and works very well.
The price is unbelievable.
I bought two sets, because I didn't want to have to keep reaching in my dishwasher to retrieve a fork or spoon.
Now I think I'm going to get a third set--then I'll have everything matching for those crazy family gatherings.
For the money, this set would be hard to beat.
Nice Set
I really only use a couple knives from this and the scissors but it is a lovely set.
I like how much space it frees up to have them neatly in the block.
Good, neat looking
I dont know what to say, i dont have to make flatware purchases ever, i know nothing of flatware...this is decent and looks good.
comparing to the previous reviews, the forks are actually real sturdy.
they are nothing compared to regular flimsy plastic utensils.i love them, and we are using them for a bridal shower.
Bright & shiny & durable so far, knife issue is no problem.
Have been using since early November and love this flatware.
My dishwasher has no drying cycle which Henckels recommends, but the flatware comes out just fine.
great flatware
so glad I purchased this item.
I have absolutely no complaints about this product.
Great set of knives
This set of knives is awesome!
I love that it contains the couple of knives I consider essential (chefs, utility and paring) AND a set of 8 steak knives all in a block!
This product seems fine so far, but the knife block that I received is black and the knives do not say ginsu on them, nor does the block.
Fun purchase!
I absolutely love this cutlery set.
THE BEST GADGET EVER!!!
My dad gave me some Rada knives over 25 years ago since he swore by them and they are all going strong still and I have added some also over the years and I've used nothing but this little sharpener on them to maintain a razor sharp edge.
I have many other knives too and after every use make a few passes through it to hone the edge perfectly.
Very dull knives should be run through a carbide type sharpener first and then finished with the Rada for best results..
I love the classic styling of this set and the weight came as a pleasant surprise.
I look forward to using this set of flatware for years to come!
Perfect price. Perfect Flatware.
So when I saw this cute, simple set I had to pick it up.
I love the smaller spoon and smaller fork.
They work well and have a nice size and texture.
Worked out very well...though out of 20 I'm already down to 16.
Good qualty
Good qualityand very nice to use, my mother very happy when she used itthank you very muchbyer
Excellent value
For under thirty dollars, you cannot go wrong.
The blades really live up to the cliche "Sharp as a razor."
The wood block looks very nice too.
These knives were reviewed in a leading consumer magazine and were highly recommended.
The knives surely are very sharp.
They are all very well balanced.
I think for our pruposes they would do spelndidly.
We are vegetrians and it is going to be a pleasure cutting vegetables with this set of knives.
Although I was initially skeptical about the scissors, even they may be useful.
The maximum thickness of the blade(not the cutting edge) is thicker than a traditional, quality Japanese knife (such as the Sandoku) and that alone plays a major role in the QUALITY of cutting (the thinner the blade, past the cutting edge, a more precise cut is attained and thus the higher the quality of the cut).I used a high magnification microscope to examine eveness/smoothness of the blade's cutting edge and was amazed at the plethora of not only imperfections but also extensive 'chipping' which definately leaves the edge uneven and has a negative effect on the quality of cuts.In the past I have examined other Japanese-style chef knives and could barely detect any such adverse characteristics - the difference of course on those knives is their much higher pricing (about 5 to 1 ratio) than the pricing of the Ginsu knives.
After less than 30 minutes of cutting you will be able to tell that the knife has become dull.CONCLUSION : In search of great Japanese-style knives (and there are many but way more expensive) if you choose the Ginsu Chikara (chinese-made) knives you just get exactly what you pay for (inferior product for less $$).
This is a very nice knife set for the price.
I certainly could have found other sets for a lot more money, but this set meets my needs very well.
The block is of good quality and looks very nice on my kitchen counter.
I love this flatware set.The best value out there and the best price!heavy duty metal too.
These knives are well worth the money.Watch out though..very sharp.
Great product at a reasonable price
Chicago Cutlery quality and the in-block sharpener works very nicely.
Now our knives are always sharp.
Coming up on a year and the knives still look brand new.
Best bang for the buck!
I simply can not believe how great this set is for so little money?Super sharp, well balanced, attractive, seemingly great quality...How do they do it?
I read the reviews before ordering and most people favor these knives.
great product
The Chikara knife set is a quality product and you can't beat the price.Would recomend to any one.
Great Starter Knife Set
This knife set is wonderful!
The knives were sharp right out of the box, and we've been using them for four months with no discernible difference in their cutting ability.
I'm actually buying two sets as Christmas presents right now.
Great knives!!
These are some really good knives for the money!!
They are really worth the money, you want regret buying these!
I looked high and low for quality disposable flatware, these did the trick.
I will most definitely order these again.
Inexpense but well crafted
The block and knives are well constructed.
The price was fair and much lower than the local stores.
Size, weight, construction & appearance are all outstanding.
The controls are great, it's really good looking, and it works fine.
Even the popcorn setting is perfect.
Nice oven with a few drawbacks
After a lot of research, we finally decided on this brand and model.Pros:This is a large oven.
It is a powerful oven.
Things that took 90 seconds in our old oven only take 60 seconds in this one.
Operating noise is very low.
Since the end-of-cycle beep is not nearly as loud and irritating as our old oven, we chose to leave this function "on.
"Conclusion:Although not perfect, we are satisfied overall after using this unit for two months.
Good, Versatile Microwave
This microwave lives up to the claims made in its description.
The defrost mode works quite well, without starting to cook the food.
There are many useful modes, for reheating, cooking from frozen, and keeping foods warm.
Great for the small area I needed for.
Good for cooking and warming.
Black with white lettering is very attractive.
This microwave is 1) the perfect size, 2)comes with excellent directions for using the technology, and 3)cooks beautifully!
It's just large enough without looking huge on the counter.
The "add one minute" feature is wonderful for making gravy, or for adding just enough heat when you need it.
Sure beats the heck out of our old white Wal-Mart microwave.
Now we have quicker meal prep and, to top it all off, it looks great!
Very happy with this purchase!
Great and powerful microwave
It's got lots of power, and has a versatile keypad, which means you are not limited to 5 second increments as you are with some microwaves.
We mainly use it for heating food and it has worked perfectly fine for that.
And the Panasonic microwave I have at home is 12 years old, and works like new.
Great product
Great microwave, very powerful, with easy to use features.
The turbo defrost feature really comes in handy too.
Works great, does excellent job with frozen dinners.
Good microwave for the price
This is a good microwave and very reasonably priced.
I've only been using this for a week and there have been no issues with it functioning, but it's a little too small for our needs.
18 month old loves it!
Boys love buttons, and toddlers love to "help" around the house, so this little microwave is a big favorite of my son.
I paid 15 at TRU, which feels like about the right price to me.
Cute oven... but doesn't work for too long.
This is a cute oven.
It arrived in good time and was as described.
Overall this is a decent microwave.
I think the style and look is good.
It also has a "quick minute" button, which is good, but it, too, still requires that you press the "start" button.
You also have to press this button between 1 and 9 times to select the food group--again a stupid button trick.All in all, it's a fine appliance at a good price.
Great Microwave
Microwave works great and I like all the different features.
Every aspect of this purchase was accomplished in a timely and efficient manner.
The product far exceeds expectations.
I would recommend this product to a friend.
4 yeas and going strong
Great smaller unit,  I got it for a smaller apartment.. use it for heating coffee, left overs, soups, and small plates,  Works great.
Defrost a snap.
I have really got my monies worth..
I find it reliable and easy to clean... simple microwave for simple uses.
IMPROVED OVER OLDER GENUIS MODELS
Works as expected, exactly fits where the old P. Genius was and has more inside room!
I really like the function button & the reminder beep.
It replaced an 1100 watt microwave and I was hesitant to purchase one that had less power, but this microwave has surpassed my expectations.
It cooks evenly, is fast and very quiet.
Sears Kenmore is always tried and true.
But this works better than the more expensive built-in microwave (by GE) at twice the price.
Big microwave, fits a family pack of chicken thighs no problem.
Love the inverter turbo defrost enter the weight of the frozen item and it thaws it out every time without cooking it one bit.
Great mico wave.
It is a high powered micro wave and very straight forward to use.
Great purchase!
I've had it now for about two weeks and its great!
Seriously, it's nothing to worry about.I say buy it if you're looking for a small but durable microwave.
Bought the Panasonic NN-H765BF Full Size 1.6 Cubic Feet, 1250-Watt Microwave Oven, Black, for wife, and both of us are very positively impressed!
Very good quality.
Easy to use and to clean.
Heats foods evenly and at right temperature.
Great Microwave!
Extremely Satisfied User
We can cook more than one item at a time due to its large capacity, which is a real time saver!
In addition, we feel that this microwave does a good job cooking or defrosting in sensor mode (unlike our previously owned models).
We cook all the time at home, so we have high expectations of functionality, design, and reliability when it comes to microwaves and this model meets all of them!
Powerful, Even Heater
The Panasonic is a powerful unit and the "Inverter" feature does seem to heat the food more evenly.
Our old GE unit would do a good job of heating the edges of the food items and leave a cold core, but not the case with this unit.
The dial is a handy feature, whether using it to set the clock, timer or cook time.
There is no problem seeing what is inside the 1.2 cubic foot space unless one is using it in complete darkness.
It is a good looking appearance and cabinet, and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well.Our unit does have a rather loud beep volume, and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other Panasonic microwave models.
This unit isn't five-star-perfect, but for the most part we are very satisfied with it.
It's big and stainless steel, I must buy it.
Works great, pops popcorn in 2 minutes!
I love the size I never have to worry about popcorn which is the main reason I use it!
It worked fine until 4 days after the warranty expired and the magnatron went out again.
Luckily the actual door did not open but the only way to turn the microwave off is to unplug it from the wall.
Great for the price
It's bigger but not so big it takes up an entire counter.
It's a great family-size unit.
One hot micro
Bought this for daughter for her new home she loves micro  price was great and shipping was fast she loves all the features
The unit performed flawlessly and awaits my next trip.
Innovative functionality; why didn't they think of this before?
Controls are intuitive, and the power is adequate.
Works Great
I purchased this item about a month ago and I love it.
It is easy to operate and cooks food evenly.
Like the new technology
very nice unit.
the new technology is great, i use sensor reheat quite frequently, it heats my dishes up nicely without getting so hot it burns you.
Plenty of room, easy to use.
Excellent Microwave
Looks great and works great.
I especially like the buttons and controls.
The discrete buttons provide good tactile feedback and are much nicer that those membrane switch panels most microwaves use.
It was also an exact fit in the cabinet so that it almost looks like a built-in.
Good little microwave
It works just fine with no complaints for what we purchased it for.
Sleek and powerful with a small price tag.
I like the overall design and ease of this product.
I like that the microwave beeps if you have left food in there after the timer has stopped.
It's fairly powerful for its size and wattage and has been going strong for at least 9 months now so I can't complain as I see it lasting into the future.
I love this microwave even though all I've done so far is basic microwaving.
It's nice and fast, heats and reheats extremely well.
In time, I'll be trying some of the other features, but for right now, it's great for my needs.
This Commercial Oven is Great in Our Home
The Panasonic has a sturdier feel, and unlike all but our original microwave, this has a stirred beam, not a carousel.
The cavity is actually slightly smaller than the predecessor, but is working better for big dishes as a result of the dishes not rotating.
I am now enthusiastically recommending Commercial models to friends and family.
The only down side is that our kitchen microwave projects now feel a bit like being at the company break room, or a convenience store.
This is a very large stainless steel microwave.
Its is attractive, easy to use, and heats foods very evenly.
At about $250, it was a real bargain.
It ilso is very lightweight for a microwave this size.
With Amazon Prime, I had it less than 48 hours after I ordered it.
Arguably 2* is a bit harsh, but I do actively recommend against buying this.It's a pretty good looking unit which generates microwaves like a champ - no complaints there.
It's not exactly difficult, but it certainly isn't as easy as tapping a digit or 3 to set a time directly.It's a high power machine so dialing it back makes sense quite often - and that's why it has the inverter feature.
We now have a post-it note stuck over the display at night.It's not quiet - not the loudest either.
The unit does have good power and the sensors and turntable operate well.
The inverter technology makes the unit light and the stainless steel exterior is attractive.
The Panasonic NN-H965BF fit my needs but could only be found on line.
I love this microwave and it is easy to use.
Works really well
I like the size of this Micro, doesn't take up as much room as my last one, but has same wattage and better features.
I love the reheat sensor, works perfect every time.
This is as easy to open and close as any Micro I've owned.
Amazon has this priced very well, don't hesitate to purchase if it's the size, color and price that fits your needs.
Yup, the best microwave I've ever had - redux
And out of the box, it has worked flawlessly, just like the first one did.
Well made little machine.
Have had this microwave for 10 years and four moves and it is still going strong.
Compact unit works great, so far.
I bought this microwave because it had the most power of any compact unit.
It takes up less space than my old Kenmore, heats quickly, and so far, I haven't found any hot spots.
Very nice microwave for a very small price!
This is a very good looking, full powered microwave.
It has a lot of special features that we may never use, but they're there if we want them.
The main reason I love this oven is because it is large enough to hold a 9"x13" pan.
The turntable works great and the oven is fairly quiet.
I'm very glad to have purchased it at such a low price.
We've had this microwave for several months now, after replacing an old one that was having trouble (which 1/4 of the plate that it decided to heat on any given day was apparently determined by the phases of the moon, or possibly sun spots).First of all, this is a good size microwave.
If you are upgrading from a smaller one, be sure to check the dimensions listed in the product description before ordering.It's very well built.
All of the buttons, the dial, the door and its release mechanism are all very solid.
The inner rotating tray and the rotation mechanism that it sits on are also well done -- even with a really lopsided load, the rotation of the tray remains smooth.The performance of this microwave has been stellar.
As mentioned in another review, the Popcorn mode is perfect -- I have yet to see a single burnt piece come out of a bag.
The "Sensor Reheat" mode has been spectacular for me as well.
As a matter of fact, just yesterday I used it to reheat a plate that included ground beef, mixed vegetables, and a large amount of mashed potatoes -- nothing was overdone, and the mashed potatoes were hot all the way through!The unit itself is quiet -- it probably operates at about a third of the volume of my old one (admittedly, that's not saying much).
My girlfriend thinks it's hilarious that the display says "Enjoy Your Meal" after it finishes heating.There are a number of features that I haven't tried, since I haven't had a need for them yet.
Easily the best microwave I have ever owned.
It's expensive (mine was an open box item at a local retailer, purchased for $179), but the capabilities (and the distinct sense that it will last forever) make it a worthwhile investment.
works quite well
I wanted an inverter style microwave oven to replace the aging microwave I had been using for the last 10 years.If you use the lower levels for warming soups and stews, heating frozen dinners and defrosting frozen food, this unit works great, since it can actually vary the power applied to the food, not just cycle it on and off.
This feature heats the food more evenly, without over-heating the edges of the food.
It excels at keeping food warm after the cooking or reheating is completed.I also like the LED interior lighting, which means it probably wont ever burnout and need to be replaced.The only minor issues I have with this oven: The labeling of the buttons, its hard to see in low light levels, and there is nothing on the display to indicate that the oven is indeed cooking at a lower power level like some of the other Panasonic ovens have.Overall the oven is an ideal compact oven for singles, couples, and maybe dorm use, or as a second oven for large families.
Fabulous features!
We love our new microwave!
After using this for about 7 months, we have enjoyed to features if this microwave.
Our favorite details are the melt/soften feature (works very well!)
No complaints thus far for this microwave!
I called these people and they were very nice on the phone but you've got to understand I was upset and my ears were full of tears from laying on the couch and crying over all that money I spent.
A refund of the full purchase price should be sent to me in 4 to 6 weeks.
I'll let you know and will probably have to change my rating if they pay me back my mula.
It is most certainly powerful.
Great product, great price.
I really like this large microwave, it is very simple and has a nice clean look in the white.
I would recommend this for the price.
I LOVE this microwave!
Each time I looked and felt I would not get another one on principle, but I didn't find another brand I liked.
I love it more than the two previous ones and it seems better built.
The appearance is simply cool, looking almost sci-fi.
It feels solid, the door is solid opening and closing and it works beautifully.
Didn't think it mattered, but the blue light is in fact very cool.
What a pleasure to look on Amazon and in two days it was on my door step.
No lugging it from a cart to my car.
I pushed it in and it was up and running in literally five minutes.
Very nice microwave.
Came packaged securely.
It is large enough to hold a medium sized casserole dish which is unusual with most microwaves.
I would definitely recommend this applicance.
Bought this Microwave a couple of years ago, and for the most part it works fine.
I trust Panasonic when it comes to microwave.
Their microwave lasts for a very long time.
It's doesn't' have that many fancy functions, but I am good with microwave.
It cooks well.
The internal is large.
Nothing much to complain about Panasonic microwaves.
Working like a champ
Update as of May 2012.Still running like a champ, buttons look like new.Who knows how many burned popcorn bags have ran through this :)..seriously, the inside top has turned black due to people burning things!..Wipe it down, air it out, and keep on trucking.I'd buy one of these again.-----------------------This microwave was purchased to replace an older unit that had been worn out at our office.
What we first noticed is it brought a cold cup of water to a boil in under two minutes!
The other 1200 watt microwaves need three or more.Upsides.
Easy to understand buttons with a 1 minute or add a minute feature.
Going with white saved about 20$ off the black unit.
Thankfully the popcorn option works beautifully.
No more stinky burned popcorn!Downsides.
Good microwave
The shipment was on time, no delay with that.The microwave is small sized and decent.
Its ideal for students and working people.
Normal sized plates do not fit in.As a student I liked this microwave.
Great Microwave
We're happy with them.My wife wanted black for our black kitchen with a large platter, I wanted it to fit the hole in the kitchen,... so fitting our criteria, I ordered this one.
This size is great, it fits dishes that are wider than most for these external and volume dimensions (15" platter).
The power is great (1:20 for tea).
We've used the sensor cooking for veggies and potatoes with great results.The front is gloss black.
I think I'd rather have a dull finish, but it easily wipes clean, so no concern.This feels like a better item than the one it replaced, so all in all that's a great start for what will likely be a long relationship...
SEEMS WELL MADE AND WORKS GREAT.
This microwave works great and the popcorn button has 3 levels depending on the size of the bag.
The first level is for the standard size so you just hit the popcorn button once and then start and it comes out great.
The size is nice, its not as tall as some weve had and the inside has a nice large glass platter that rotates.
It will also keep foods warm to serve when you are ready.
Its a nice micrwave for the price, easy to use and works well.
This new microwave has so many new features and is quite simple to use once you get cooking with it.
It is very nice looking and easy to keep clean.
I know I will be using it more and more as time goes on.
It's a winner for me.
This microwave is VERY nice and has TONS of features that we will probably never use.
The beeper is nice and not too loud, but does beep 5 times.
very nice microwve
simple to operate, quite, cooks well, easy to understand modes.
Larger than most models, but can handle larger dishes, turntable helps cook food more evenly.
Recommend this microwave
Very pleased with the microwave.
Slightly larger than my previous oven and the extra space is great.
Also very happy with the inverter feature to select true power levels.
Deeper heating.
Do it now in One and a half min.I like the automatic time selection for many foods and amounts.
Panasonic Microwave was the best choice.
Customer is happy.
Very good for the price
Return and replacement went easily per Amazon procedure.
The oven performs as advertised.
Large size good for our purpose.
We have an opening in cabinetry which this fills nicely.
Pros: Cooks evenly, 1250 Watts of power, large full size comportment, quick function buttons, rotating turntable.Cons: None so far.The Bottom Line: I definitely recommend this microwave becasuse of it's 1250 Watts of power and large size.
I am very impressed with the evenness of cooking and that it has a curved back inside to allow turning of large round items.
It fits right where I wanted it to and looks great!
Great purchase.
This microwave is large and has lots of features such as sensors that tell you when the food is hot and so on.
It works great.
We're Not Microwave Dependent - But This Is A Good One
Easy to operate.
Authentic feel to the controls.
Wonderful to reheat coffee -- and thaw frozen meat using its sensor.
I bought this oven a year back and it ran perfectly well.
My wife loved the brand, but suddenly there was a pop and it stopped working.
Great microwave
Careful examination shows that it's a divot in the door so that it swings open freely.Otherwise, this is a good product.
Cooks evenly and looks nice.
This oven might nuke just fine but it is really cheap looking!
Great Toaster!
Looked for a long time before I decided on the Hamilton Beach Classic Chrome 4-Slice Toaster, since it was so reasonably priced.
Furthermore, I have never been disappointed in buying other Hamilton Beach products.
This toaster is very stylish, looks great in our kitchen and is extremely easy to use.
I have nothing to compare it to, so I will just tell you our experience with it.First of all, it bakes very well.
Its too small to bake a layer cake, but I imagine cookies or cinnamon rolls would do very well in it.It works fairly well for toasting hamburger, hot dog, and hoagy buns when using the bagel mode.
It is large enough to make 2 servings of fries or tater tots.
It preheats quickly and baking is pretty much the same time and temperature as our big oven.
It doesn't heat up the entire kitchen.5.
The pan seems to be fairly non-stick and easy to clean up.
Its much better for reheating pizza than a microwave.
I purchased this toaster oven in hopes of making cooking a little easier and cutting down on my electric bill because I'm not using my oven.
My electric bill has been lowered significantly.
Nice for the price
We've had this toaster oven for a few months and we like it.
But the oven works great, bagels brown beautifully and plain bread does well.
And it looks really cool.
consistent toast
The browning dial works consistently well.
This toaster works faster than my previous toaster that we had for 25+ years.
I've had no issues with burning myself or my bread, and the cord's positioning and length don't seem to be an issue.
Love the look, the way it works, and the space it takes up.
It is larger than my previous toaster oven but not by much.
Its performance is so much better than my old one.
Color & quality are great
The color is perfect for the kitchen.
The toaster works very well & we are well satisfied with it.
We like the fact that we can toast bagels & english muffins as well as bread.
This model had good reviews BUT I found it did not toast evenly.
It looks less than elegant to my rarefied eye, but it functions perfectly.
Tasty Egg Muffin in 4 mins, no more drive to McDonald.
I can not believe making a restaurant quality tasty Egg Muffin at home in just few minutes.
No more drive to McDonald for me.
It is awesome to make Bagels with wide toaster slot.
I really enjoy the every penny I spent.
Best toaster I ever owned
Absolutely love this toaster.
I gave the Salvation Army four toasters last year because of uneven toasting.
This toaster toasts both side of the bread evenly.The controls are perfectly designed for easy use, and it is extremely light weight which is important to me since I do not leave my toaster out on the counter.
Worth every penny I paid for it.
Goodbye Dualit, hello Breville!
Now let me say this: If you're interested in toast, NEVER buy a Dualit toaster.
It's a mean and hurtful machine, designed to make you cry into your poorly toasted toast at the $350+ you parted with.
I was dubious about the 'automatic' motor drive system to lower and lift the toast, but it works fine, AND, best of all?
THIS IS THE BEST TOASTER I'VE EVER HAD.
Great, even toasting, slice after slice.
I'm very happy with this purchase, even though I fear from the looks of it it's part of the Cylons 'plan'.Buy it, and let Dualit know their art pieces aren't fit for actual cooking.
LOVE THIS TOASTER!!
THIS IS A GREAT TOASTER!!
I have no idea why it has so many bad reviews.
I would recommend this toaster and I would buy it again!
Loved all the features and the look.The big sell for me was the carrying handle.
This toaster is the sole reason I wake up at all, otherwise I would continue to slumber in peace.
A kitchen essential - highly recommended
We have used this oven almost daily for nearly 6 years now and it has never let us down.
It is simple to switch from the over mode to the popup toaster mode by using the clunky sliding switch, just don't forget to take out the small tray when using it as a toaster.
It is much quicker and more cost effective that using the main oven for warming small items and better that the microwave which can make pastries soggy.After so much use the glass door does not shut perfectly anymore, but it's still used daily in both capacities.A kitchen essential in my opinion.
Nice device
It works just like advertised.
There are very clear instructions, including a measuring cup for the water that is cleverly marked to help make the process easy.
I made egg sandwiches with no effort.
Unlike making poached eggs in a conventional way, these eggs came out very nice.
I have also made hardboiled eggs and they came out perfectly.I'm a little skeptical about combination products, but this one works very nicely.
Wonderful Toaster
Wonderful toaster!
I purchased this toaster after buying a cheaper one at Wal-Mart that did not work.
It works great and I would highly recommend it.
Nice features with Bagel setting (toasts inside while just warming outside), Frozen item and reheat.3.
Audible alarm when toast is done.4.
Cool touch sides5.
Wide long slots easily accomodate bagels, large slices of rye bread etc.Cons:1.
So with 7 very nice pros and 1 Con how can I only give it 2 stars?The primary function of a toaster is to toast bread/bagels/poptarts etc.
Great features!
This toaster is awesome!
Always stays cool!
And so many features it makes toasting a delight.
As always with Amazon Prime the product arrived promptly and was securely packaged.
Working well so far,good quality
Toasts very evenly ,browns eggo's perfectly on frozen setting.I used the bagel setting which browns the face side well but doesn't heat the bagle though.Works better on regular toasting setting.End of cycle beep not annoying like some others.
3 year warranty is a plus over other brands.So far very pleased with quality and operation.
We bought the T-Fal for that solution and only wish we had bought it a few years ago.
The middle range worked perfectly for me the first time and it is now the default setting.
While doing other chores the countdown timer is working within sight and the dinger goes off when complete.
The crumb tray is easy to take out and clean.
The push up handle elevates the bread to a satisfactory height for removal.
The black color is unobtrusive and few finger prints show even though they are present.It is wonderful to have products that have advanced the art of cooking.
Hoorah for technology and all it has done for us.
Way better than McDonalds!
I bought this for my male roommate and he LOVES it!
Some days it's bagels, others are english muffins and they create the best McMuffins I've had.
I'm really happy with this product!Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher
It is wide enough for bagles or for toasting buns or for a thick slice of home made bread.
The toast gradations do really work for really light to a dark brown for cold dark mornings.
All of the functions work as expected.
Price was competitive.
Excellent toaster
This toaster toasts bread quickly and evenly.
The slots are thick enough to fit a nicely sized bagel and the lever to turn on the toaster seems sturdy.
I've been using this product for over a year now and it still works like new.
All in all, this is an excellent toaster and I would recommend it to others.
I really like it and have used it 15 or so times.
The down side is a small one (well two) the top where you put the bread in will let heat out, but I knew that when I got it and a cutting board on top works just fine.
Attractive, Light weight. Doesn't feel substantial.
Not outstanding, but attractive on the kitchen counter.
good toaster
Does the job well, takes a little experimenting to understand how it works...which side to put bagel in vs a piece of bread.
Great Retro Toaster
We really love our Cuisinart toaster.
We did alot of research and few toasters offered both the look we wanted combined with all the great options this toaster has.
We particularly liked the red as it adds the right dash of color to a kitchen already full of stainless and black.
We also love the retro look as this also fits perfectly with our 50's kitchen.
Breville Does the Toasting Good
She was absolutely correct -- wide range of settings, it takes in big slices of bread with ease (no need to cut off the crusts), handles bagels with aplomb, and has a versatile and useful set of operating options (e.g., look and see, do a bit more).
Appreciated the pricing and the prompt delivery in a well protected packaging.
Great for breakfast, fast, and easy.........hard to clean though
I have been waiting for this to go on sale for a while and when I knew I could get it for $50 with free shipping I jumped at the chance to try it.
This thing rocks!
We've used this toaster/egg cooker several times now and really like it.
I wish we didn't have to spray with pam - but other than that we are very happy with it.
Great gift for a kid
Beautiful red toaster like hot dog maker that toasts the buns and cooks the hot dogs to perfection.
totally awesome toaster!
I was a little skeptical at first, especially after reading that the material is plastic, but this is a very sturdy and somewhat stylish toaster.
It toasts my toast and poaches my egg, all in a very straight forward fashion.
I would totally recomend this product.
However, the single one works fine and does not take up much space, so i am happy.
Great product!!
I love this toaster.
The slots are very long and wide so that you can fit just about any size slice of bread.
Works very well
We have only had the toaster for a week or so and we're still figuring out our toast preferences but we are very happy with it.
And we can toast 4 slices at once!
Good looking, multiple features and great performance
I was happy to replace our old, basic toaster that we have been using for the last 5 years.
The design of the toaster is very nice and will compliment many of todays kitchen appliances with the black and stainless steel look.
It toasted like a champ!
I prefer a crispy, well toasted bagel and this did it perfectly on the #4 setting.
As for regular toast I found that #3 was just right and with a frozen english muffin again #4 worked great and it's the frozen setting that really sold me.
So being able to toast right from the freezer with good results will save many a loafs, bagels and muffins from the composter.
Overall I am very happy with our new toaster and would recommend to others and the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is the price.
I do not toast very often so this serves my need well.
Toasting is a little uneven but acceptable and the outer surface stays cool, just as advertised.
Toasts Bagels great
I have purchased other Cuisinart appliances in the past and really enjoyed them.
This Toaster lives up to the name and toasts Bagels evenly on setting 3  1/2.
Would have expected it to weigh more and feel more commercial but who really wants a heavy toaster.
It works fine for me.
I use it for toasting Gluten Free bread and it works fine for that.
And it's find for this price!
A sleeve of english muffins, a box of Morningstar breakfast sausage patties, a carton of eggs, and you've got delicious breakfasts for the whole week.
It's not greasy or disgusting like McDonald's fast food, but actually makes you feel like you ate something substantial and healthy.I never write reviews for things on Amazon, but this thing has become such an integral part of my day to day routine that I had to come and give it five stars.
For ~$30-40, you can't beat it.Notes:Do get non-stick spray to use on the little egg panDo give the bottom of the egg cook area a wipe every once in a while, and do it right after cooking with it, it'll be well-steamed and easy to cleanDon't expect it to clean your dishes or do your laundry - it doesn't do thatDo enjoy a healthy breakfast on the regular, and have a good day afterward!
Excellent toaster for two slice
I certainly would recommend this toaster to anyone.
It provides fast and even toasting every time.
It's attractice and the price is exceptional.
Love this toaster
This is the best toaster that I have ever owned.
Then digital number is easy to remember and set.
It browns much more evenly than any other toaster I have owned.
The progress indicator is great.
The long slot is nice for oversized bread.
Best toaster I've ever had
The toaster is a good looking piece of equipment.
The light-dark control is very smooth operating and accurate.
I'm very pleased with the toaster.
Good value
I wonder why the manufacturer decided on that design?I like the way that odd shaped pieces of bread are easy to remove when they are toasted.
The smallest quality Toaster oven around
This Toaster Oven is an excellent combination of good looking, very small and very functional.
I love Toaster Oven!
I love it!
I am glad my stainless steel toaster died.
This red toaster is so beautiful!
I did like the fancy light up blue bars.
The Cuisnart Red Toaster would have been a good buy at the original price.
At the delivered price Cuisnart Red Toaster is a fantastic help in this depression!
Nice toaster.
This is a nice toaster.
Toasts well and evenly.
The "bit more" function and the audio indication of the toast being "up" are nice features.
awesome product
the guys love the product they use it every day of the week would recommend this product to my friends
Since finding the right water level, it has been consistent.The complaints about meat dripping into the egg are valid but its a simple thing to remedy.
You could use a paper towel if you really don't want any juice getting onto your sandwich.The meat tray has no problem making frozen (precooked) sausage patties hot.
I haven't experienced any problems with the bread getting cold or the nonstick coating coming off the egg pan yet... still wondering if that might be an issue later.
When you consider the ingredient costs vs. a mc-breakfast, it really doesn't have to last that long to be worthwhile, not to mention the convenience and health benefits.
If it lasts a year I would be totally pleased and ready to buy another.
About the only thing about it is it looks decent sitting on the counter - give it a star for that.
Like it and maybe love it!!
I think this toaster oven is a great size!
Works really well too.
BUT other than that it is a great product.
this seemed to be it!
It toasts pretty evenly and does handle the larger sizes except .
Eventually, perhaps after a year of use, the pieces inside were bent and, on one side, no longer stayed on the track.When the toaster works, it works well.
The size is perfect and it even looks nice.
Trouble is, for the price, it's one of the few toasters that can do two bagels at once or a long piece of homemade bread.As long as you keep in mind that it might need replacing in a year or so, it's not the worst purchase.
Love It!
Love the push button for toast vs. a timer you have to twist, not too big and not too small
Worked perfect for me.
Works exactly how it should.My egg and bagel or muffin are always done and perfect everytime.I slap some cheese and a slice of ham and in 5 min i'm breakfast bound.I honestly can't find a thing wrong with this awesome toaster.
Great product
I would recommend it also if you don't have counter space it's really wide.
The main positive is that it heats and toasts really quickly.
And it is compact and looks good.
Love the line of colors for kitchen accessories, this toaster works great, is cheap and does not show finger prints.
Small counter space, wide toaster slot and a bit of an oven.
Any bread that's soft and not perfectly flat will get stuck when it pops up and get smashed up against the heating element.If you never put anything in except a very small pizza slice and toast only pre-sliced white bread, it's probably a great little machine.
Brave Little Toaster!
We pretty much make toast, bagels and english muffins with our toaster, and we love it.
The bagel setting is particularly cool.
It's easy to use, and I don't miss the tick tick tick our old toaster used to make.
We also have warmed pizza in this toaster and it also does a nice job with that.
And the pull-out crumb tray is a big hit in our house.
If it's durable, we'll have this one for a long time.
A Great Product
My husband has his eggs and toast every morning and this product was a blessing.
Now he gets his toast and egg at the same time, where before he had to put his bread in the toaster and poach his egg on the stove.
The old toaster only toasted part of the bread, but this toaster does the whole slice.
Thank You for a Great Product.
good for price
we like it and is serves its purpose.
excellent for the $$
Bakes, broils, and toasts evenly.Great slide out crumb catcher.
Excellent value for the money.
Heard that it makes good toast and the dual control is a plus when two people like theirs different colors.
This is a great toaster oven for the price.I was looking for a smaller type of toaster oven and was not thinking of this one due to the stated measurements.
Exchanged it and the second one works amazing.
No frills toaster, except for the bagel setting which I think is neat.
Setting 5 toasts bread perfectly
not happy to find that there was not timer for broiler and baking.................  otherwise, find that it works just fine
This thing will get the job done....from fish sticks to frozen waffles... you will not be disappointed.
Also, the new cancel button is sweet!
TWO YEARS LATER...AFTER FIVE YEARS, STILL GOING STRONG, SO KEEPING THIS FOR NOW AFTER TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING NEWER/BETTER
THIS IS AN UPDATE TWO YEARS LATER (01/13)...STILL WORKING AS DESCRIBED BELOW...KEEPS GOING AND GOING...I'm writing this review out of frustration re: trying to find a new toaster, and we're now going to keep this one, and you may want to give it a try, too.
It's still going strong.
Toasts pretty evenly, the selector dial is dependable to get the done-ness you want.
We just tried an Oster and returned it, toasts one side black if you get the other side even slightly brown.
Same with a Cuisinart that we returned from Christmas.
And, btw, re: other reviewers' comments: you can force the toast up if you want to, it just takes a little effort, and after five years of doing it, the handle shows no signs of breaking from the pressure.Today's manufacturing being what it is, I suppose you can always get a bad one, but if you get one that works, this is a fine little toaster.
IN SUM: If this toaster toasted a bit faster, I'd give it five stars.
The exterior of ours is a little worn looking, doesn't really fit in with the rest of our brushed steel/chrome counter appliances, which is why we decided to look for a new one, but it toasts dependably well, which is more than I can say for those last two $50+ models we tried.
Bagels - great - it toasts one side nicely.
Looks pretty
It's pretty, and I'm not sure what another reviewer was saying about only 1 side working.
Sturdy toaster
under-$20 Proctor Silex's good.
Survives minor fires inside it, and has a nice sliding heat range.
We love this toaster oven.
It fits nicely on our counter w/o taking up too much space.
It's great for nights when we do nuggets or other quick foods.
Much better than turning on the oven.
Sandwich lovers, rejoice!
If I were stranded on a desert island and could bring only one kitchen appliance, it would be this toaster.toaster's elegant.
toaster's heavy duty.
And it makes perfect toast, each and every time.My family lives on bread.
toaster is by far the best.It toasts evenly on the outside of the bread, but the inside stays moist!It fits bagels easily, and has a dedicated button for its special needs.
There is also a separate Defrost button for your frozen waffles.I love how there are no levers, so you can't be tempted to pop it up and ruin the toasting cycle.Press the button, and the toast descends.
"It's ingenious.
It feels futuristic, and yet it couldn't be simpler.Really, I love this toaster.
Shopped around for stainless steel trash can and the price and look and performance is awesome.
The trash can seems be very good quality and looks great.
Very nice and unique item.
I have had the step on kind that eventually broke.
These cans are very fashionable.
I never knew that throwing away trash could be so fun.
The cans are complimenting to the kithchen and bathroom.
Price is excellent.
You could easily pay more for one that is not made withe sensor motion lid opening.
would highly recommend this purchase.
LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I had my reservations about this garbage pail even though I love the concept.
I took a chance and ordered it anyway.My congrats to Nine Stars for the opening system they created.
The can itself is great looking and the stainless steel is very easy to clean.
It fits in perfectly with all my other stainless steel appliances.
Battery life seems to be long as I'm still on the same three 'C' batteries for the month I've had it.
Everyone in my family seems to have a stainless steel can but I couldn't justify the cost when this trash can is so reasonably priced, sturdy, and well-made.
Never Knew I could Like a Trashcan this much!
I love not having a top.
Not having a lid has not been a problem with our dog nor with smell or unsightly trash because the trash is down so far in the can that those things are not an issue.
This can is thin and tall, looks so good in the kitchen.
If I had a hidden can I wouldn't spend this much money, but with our can being out - I wanted to have a nice looking can that was easy to use.
Great Trash Can
We have had it in the house for two months now and everything works great.
It looks great and is stylish.
13 Gal bags work well in the cans but when the can is full the bag is full also, there is not alot of extra space to tie the bag so if you could find a little bigger bag i would recommend it or use the 13 gal with the build in handles.Its so nice when you have something messy or sticky you just move your hand in front of it and it opens you drop your trash no muss no fuss.
I cant say for sure but it has to keep the spreading of germs down also.
Not haveing to touch the trash can everytime makes it a clean operation.
Plus the lid closes quickly and keeps all the odors bottled up.The opening is very nice sized and almost everyting we have had to throw away fits in without having to force it, it just drops in.One added bonus is the kids like to use it...
They are severely overpriced but the good news is that this one is less expensive than many that are out there today!
It's a nice looking piece and 13 gallon bags fit it perfectly without billowing over the top.
It's an option that is nice but you don't have to use it if you don't wish to.
It works great and I love the trash can.
Great product
Love the quality of this manufacturer.
Easy to use, very solid and know we will have years of use.
Highly recommend it to anyone seeking a 'no touch' trash can.
And kids love using it (another plus)...
Great kitchen garbage can. How did we do without it?
Everyone qt our house really likes the garbage can.
It has the same capacity as our other garbage can and it's much cleaner (no more spillage on the top of the lid.I recommend it!
Great product
Great product
We love product.
It is amazing how much stuff you can cram in.
This is a great quality and value.
I plan on buying another one soon since this one seems durable and functional.
Great product
Great trash can for outside.
It is water tight so your trash bag does not get filled with water.
The lid also locks so it is not flapping around in the wind.
returned first one now perfect
got a replacement and it works great .
Awesome Trash Can!
Reviewing a trash can seems silly to me, however, I felt so obliged to tell everybody on this site what a wonderful product this truly is.
It holds a lot of trash, and keeps the smell level considerably down (compared with regular trash cans).
Additionally, the sensor works great, and I haven't had any problems with it.
I even like changing the bag.
I thought I would not like the fact that there was no lid to this can.
However, unless you are standing right next to the can, you don't notice the trash inside.
One of my biggest fears were smells and I have not noticed any.
Lastly, I have found that it is more convenient to be able to throw things right in without having to lift a lid.
Great Trash can for the money
I have had this for about a month now and it works great.
It's got a larger opening than the last one I had which makes it easier to put things in it.
For the money this is a great buy.
We like it
we are happy with it.
This garbage can saved my messy room from having garbage all over the place.
garbage can is very sturdy, and has very nice quality.
Anyway, yes it is very nice, and holds a lot.
Nice little waste can.
We need one twice as big for our kitchen, sadly, but it is of good quality.
Great little trash can!
This is the perfect trash can for your bedroom or living room!
Holds just as much as any other wastebasket, but the skinny shape makes it perfect reusing grocery bags, and the handle makes carrying it extra convenient.
I've been using this trash can for 5 months now - it performs flawlessly!A nice sleek look in the kitchen, easy (and amusing) for kids.It does seem to "like" my black bath robe, if I walk by wearing it, the trash can opens, but its not a big deal!
Excited about a garbage can?
The locking lid is great if you have inquisitive pets, or for making frequent trips while cooking.
The shape is also more accommodating for bulkier trash items (13 gallon bags fit very nicely).
LOVE IT for our pool area
It was a cinch to put together (less than 5-minutes).
Large capacity outdoor trash bags fit perfectly and it looks beautiful on our patio.
the Rolodex 22351 Mesh round wastebasket, 11-1/2 diameter x 14-1/4h, black is a great addition to any office.
blends very nicely and is the perfect size to place beside or underneath  your desk.
Great buy at a great price
Anyway It's the perfect size for a little bedroom garbage under a desk, or next to a sewing machine like my wife uses it for.
If you have a lot of paper, or larger size things you need to throw away you're probably better off finding a full size dumpster, cause this thing is tiny, but for things like bits of string and candy wrappers, this is the garbage you need!
I love this garbage can and it looks great in my kitchen however it is quite expensive.
fits under a massage table
Neat design, lid swings easily, stable, and fits under a massage bed.
I think is well made and easy to use if you need a trash can covered at all times, but easy to open and not noisy.
Great product!
The trash can was a snap to assemble out of the box.
The sensor is very accurate.
Works great.
Plus, it is a 13 gallon bin.
good for first year, now is stinky
This worked great for the first year and was well worth the price.
This can is nice and narrow.
It fits into just about any narrow crevice.
If you have a rather small restroom, this is perfect.
It feels sturdy, looks beautiful, and you really can't beat the price.Mine is purple and it is such a lovely, deep, chalky, blue-purple.
The picture is very accurate.
Favorite trash can
Great space saver next to the toilets, etc.
Thick material.
Colors are great.
Score another win for simplehuman!
Simplehuman came through again with another perfect product; convenient size, great price and looks great.
Love the ease of replacing bags with a standard 10gal.
I loved the fact that this trash container has a slide lock open and close.
We have it sitting on our deck and it looks very nice.
Great for an unorthodox use
After getting a second cat and discovering the automatic litterboxes are pretty much useless, we switched back to regular scooping.
I originally looked at diaper pails, but they were about twice the cost (I got this for $20 with Prime shipping).
There's a removable plastic insert which we line with a trash bag, and the lid fits quite well, so to date I have not noticed any extra odor when it is shut.
It also has a 10 year warranty which floored me, since I've never even heard of a warranty on a trash can.
So it might be a little overkill for an office or bedroom, but if you want to reduce trash bag numbers and need to prevent solid waste from stinking up your house, give this trash can a look.
Finally,the PERFECT trash can-in every model,in every way !!!
I first purchased the 8 gallon plastic model and it was amazing in every way.Never again would I have trouble wiping off a dinner plate or drippy leftovers having to somehow manipulate the poorly designed (but good effort) lids on every trash can ever made.No foot pedal to jerk around with,no more ugly bag hanging over,just move over the perfectly measured and designed lid and voila,the best part of the meal is here!
Yes,that's how beautiful this invention is and works.So I decided to pass this model on to my mom and go for the 13 gallon stainless steel model.While the lid is slightly smaller than the plastic model,on account of the sleek "wall hugger space saver"design,which required a little better aim til I got used to it,I was even more pleased with the beauty of the unit and overall I was happy with my decision.But don't get me wrong, the 8 gallon plastic model works just as well and is a sharp little trashcan,as far as trash cans go.Both trashcans are lightning fast.As fast as you can put your hand in front of the lid,bang,it pops right up.It stays up til you're done,move away and boom,it pops down.It's quiet enough.Nice little whirling sound.It has an on/off button on the back,in case kids wanna play around with it,or around it.
Worse comes to worse you can take out the 6 "D"batteries that should last for years if the kiddies figure out the on/off button.But that's unlikely.It has a "stay open" button as well,for those busy occassions.AND, they both stay as clean as you choose to keep them because it's so easy to "hit the mark" every time!
It has a "ring",which tightly and neatly holds down any type of bag and hides the overlap very cleverly so it doesn't get soiled( BE CAREFUL NOT TO FORGET TO REMOVE THE RING WHEN CLOSING THE FULL BAG, OR OUT WITH THE BAG TO THE STREET IT WILL GO!!!).
Just a wipe on the top now and then for dust.The design allows you to make the most of each and every garbage bag.No more half full ,wasted bags.Every inch of the bag is used and when it's ready to go there's just the right amount of overhang to close it up.
AMAZING!EVERY household should have one of these.It is truly a thing of the future, here TODAY!
Great step can
Their dog likes to sneak into the trash, so the locking feature really helps.
We were all amazed by how slender the can is.
It doesn't take up much space in the kitchen.
On the other hand, it holds quite a bit of rubbish.
Glad we made this purchase.
Excellent for the first year
While this garbage can is awesome in the beginning, it just doesn't stand the test of time.
Cool garbage can
Very sharp looking garbage can.
Easy to change bags.
I love the motion sensor open feature.
Price is also a big plus.
I purchased this can in August 2011, I am still on the batteries that came with this.
I love this can.
It blocks all odors and I love the look and functionality of this can.
I work in the Healthcare field and all my friends and co-workers are amazed at the automatic lid.
Skipping around about a garbage can!
I'm really happy with this purchase!
The kitchen can is great and similar items at other retailers sell for like over hundred dollars!
I purchased over a month ago and they seem to function just fine for me.
Great trash can!
I love my new trash can and so does everyone who sees it at work!
Great quality and it looks great!
This can is great for its value.
It holds more than my previous 13 gallon trash can and contains the odor well.
fits grocery bags well
Love it!!!
Love it!
So much better than any others I have had!
Perfect for keeping my toddler out of the trash!
We would have to inspect the contents of every trash bag before taking the trash out.I am SO PLEASED with this purchase.
The little mister has tried and cannot open the lid, thus, the bad stuff is staying in and we are no longer finding shoes or cordless phones in the trash can.I ordered the Grey and I am really glad I did.
This is it - it's perfect.
It was easy to assemble - 5 minutes max - but do look at the instructions first.
The trash bin locks in the odors so we haven't had problems with coyotes and other scavengers we have in our canyon being attracted to our deck.
We are very pleased with this purchase.
I also was sick of my old trash cans and thought garbage cans were a nifty idea.
They arrived, were very simple to assemble and were the perfect sizes for the kitchen and the smaller one for the bathroom.
I was very happy with myself for finally replacing the cans and especially with these "cool" automatic ones.
My son easily learned how to use them and I will say they held up to a lot of abuse!
This can comes with a ring that hides the trash bag to make it look neater.
Great for adult Depends disposal
This is far better than putting them in a garbage can in the bathroom because the lid contains the smell of urine.
It is just the right size to use grocery plastic bags over the edge on the inside so emptying is quick by pulling the bag out and tying the ends.
The foot lift feature works but isn't necessary as the top lifts easily.
I am very pleased with my purchase.
No more urine smell in the bathroom area!
Great price for both.
I'm happy I found stainless steel trash can.
Works well and batteries don't run out too fast.
Easy to clean.
Motion sensor works really good.
Arrived fast and undamaged.
I'm very happy with this purchase.
This basket is sturdy and well made.
It's light and easy to handle and very well made.
I have had an iTouchless automatic trash can for 4 years now and love it...you don't have to lift the lid or have an open top trash container in the house.
Immediately I ordered another one...boy was I lost until the new one arrived.
I would highly recommend this trash can to everyone.
Thanks iTouchless!
And the shipping was really fast from Amazon...had the trash can in 3 days.
You can definitely trust Amazon to stand behind the products they sell and for fast shipping.
It collects my refuse without so much as an utterance.
They clean easily.
This trash can solves both problems.
The bag is contained within the trash can and the deodorizer really takes care of the smell.
Since the cats don't smell the food they don't get into the can.
Once the cats got used to the lid closing automatically (which I love) they don't run away when it does close.
it is a nice trash can.
received in good condition.
Great alternative to SimpleHuman
The $200 price tag for a comparable product from SimpleHuman was too much for me to stomach.
This one is way better: it was less than half the price and I think the compartments are actually slightly larger.
I could foresee a slight inconvenience trying to clean the nine stars product, but I don't overstuff my trash bags and so I don't need to clean out my waste bin that often.I have no complaints about the sensor (see other reviews - seems to be a persistent issue), but I've had the product for only about a month and a half.
Nice trash can
I really like this trash can.
The lid is wide and deep enough when it opens.
well built
I have owned others like this, but none work as well.
It slides effortlessly, it stays where you leave it, it seems well built... overbuilt!
I really love this product...I bought the larger can years ago for much more than the price of the 2 cans from amazon.
Very please with both products.
Good Strong ProductMy wife bought this for the inground pool area.Easy to put together, BUT  follow the DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY  !
It went together fast.RonDover, Pa
Seems like a solid product..
I have been using this trash can in my kitchen for about a month now and I couldn't be happier.
Looks solid and durable, not flimsy and cheap.
It's easy to put the bags in and out.
I am certainly not going back to the messy and unattrative manual trash cans after this one.
Works great and doesnt stink up the kitchen
Well made/durable product.
Easy to instal.
Slides in and out smoothly and with little effort.
I still like the system though and would definitely recommend it to a friend!
Love it!
Product works great.
The free small trash can works even better than the large one!
Love it, Love it, Love it!
The best trash bin EVER
This is the best trash bin I ever brought and I have been married for 30 years.
It not only is the best working trash bin on the market, it's a great conversation piece.
I tend to put my foot/feet on the edge of wastebaskets and the rubber ones do not hold up.
This wastebasket is working perfectly.
Wish I had purchased this trash can sooner
This trash can replaced a foot pedal one, which didn't work as well as I had hoped.
Love the iTouchless.
It is so handy when your hands are full and you need an extra hand to open the trash can lid.
I had some reservations based on previous reviews, but my experiences with this product over the last 2 months have all been good.
Plenty big and I love that it snaps shut to keep the trash in!
Great trash can, works flawlessly.
I've had this trash can for about 8 months now and have not had a problem with the mechanism or the sensor.
Very good product, would recommend to everyone.
Like it
I like that I can lock it on top.
I live in countryso I was a little worried about animals.
The trash can met my expectations.
Holds a good amount of trash & the locking feature is wonderful ecspecially with a one year old!
Overall a great purchase though!
Just the right size
One load a day takes care of both babies needs, and I don't have a ton of diapers hanging out.For the way that we use this pail it works out very well.
I do not even need to use the scent basket at all.
Less waste/garbage and no stink.
Excellent Small Trash Can for the Bathroom
I chose this can only because it was the smallest white can with stainless, but it exceded my expectations.It was my plan to put this between the toilet and sink vanity(a tight fit), however, I didn't take into account for the can lid and toilet tank, so now whenever I push step to open it, the lid will clink the toilet tank.
I was debating about returning it and ordering a can without a lid, but we decided that we really this can.I honestly was suprised at how perfect this can looked, and is constructed... Now it just needs a few knicks or scratches so it will match the rest of the house!UPDATE: I noticed a few reviewers are worried that the can may be break because of a plastic piece, even though I didn't see anybody actually SAY that it DID break...
The can is covered by a TEN YEAR WARRANTY from Simplehuman.
Will never go back to a regular trash can again...
Anyway, the location where I keep the trash can in my kitchen is an awkward area where a step-type can isn't easy to use.
I had wanted a stainless steel can for years, but they were so expensive I held off buying one, and I'm glad I did, because when I came across the iTouchless I was amazed.
You just wave your hand about 5 inches from the lid and it magically opens for you to deposit the waste.
Battery life is great; I change them maybe once a year.
The trash bag is kept hidden by the inner ring; and I've had no problems with mine as others have reported.
Overall it's a superb trash can at a reasonable price.
Nothing wrong with this!
Love:-This can be set against the wall because of it's half-circle shape-When you open it (using foot), it slowly closes and therefore doesn't slam or make any noises when fully closing-All of the pieces are sturdy/durable.
Forget all of those expensive diaper pails
This has to be one of the best purchases we made for the new baby.
The plastic seems a little thin, but when you put it together it is sturdy enough.
It fit well when assembled.
I like the fact that the lid has a latch.
So far we have not had the lid fly open during storms, and we get windy storms here.
Also, the inside has stayed dry when the unit has gotten wet.
Overall great purchase for the price.
Perfect Trash Can (two months and counting)
The iTouchless (13 gallon) solved those problems for us, and after two months we think it's the perfect trash can.Before we purchased the iTouchless we read a few reviews.
My wife was concerned that the can itself would be too weak, since one of the reviews said it dents easily.
I don't know what that reviewer was doing with his/her can, but it is definitely strong enough (i.e., as strong as any other metal trash can in the price range) and unless you are throwing rocks at it, I can't see how it would get dented.
We have had absolutely no problems with lid; the two buttons make it easy to keep open when you need, and if you're not using it you can turn it off in the back, which is also very accessible.As for the reviews that mention the plastic cracking, I have not seen any cracks on the plastic rim.
It is pretty solid plastic, so unless you are trying to bend it when pulling the trash bags out, I can't see how it would crack and break.
So to find a trash can at this price which works this well is really a good deal.
Very nice product, highly recommend it to others.
5 stars all the way.Totally worth the 10 bucks!
Love it.
I cannot live without this garbage can!
I have had this trash can for 3 years, and it's still going strong.
The pedal has not failed.
I have a small galley kitchen, and the trash can fits perfectly without taking up the whole kitchen yet it's large enough for my roommate and me to use daily for all of our trash (not just kitchen trash), except bathroom trash and recyclables.
I use 13 gallon trash bags (regular drawstring kind, not Simplehuman trash bags) and I think they fit really well.
I like how the round trash can molds my trash into a round shape so it'll fit down my apartment building's trash chute much more easily.
I'm not a fan of spending too much for a trash can, but this was the only one at the store that fit but was still large enough to hold sufficient amount of trash, had hands-free operation, and was stainless steel.
I can't smell any trash when the can is closed.
But I'm assuming it's still better than plastic.
Best trash can ever
I wish they made one that could detect and open in one hundredth of a second so it would open when I toss something from across the room, but for walking over and dropping it in it's great.
For the price it is powerful, light-weight, and easy to assemble to clean and use hose implements.
great vacuum, great price
Great vacuum, picks up pet hair great.
I have 2 dogs and 2 cats and a toddler and my floors are cleaner than ever!
Dirt container is a little small, but I don't mind emptying more often cause the thing works great.
I have had my new Hoover for nearly a month now and I am very happy with it!
The quality is superior to my last vacuum and using it is a pleasure.
The canister is also perfect for my needs (stairs and cobwebs) and super powerful.
I am glad I didn't buy the Oreck at Costco...plus I can get the Hoover bags at almost any store.
Never a Better Vacuum
I've had this Vacuum Cleaner for over a year and not One Complaint.
It's lightweight, and still works like a charm.
I have two shedding dogs and the dirt and hair just gets sucked up with no problem.
a Vacuum Cleaner that is lightweight that WORKS!!
Love it!
I've finally found it in the Hoover floormate!
It really cleans, and leaves my floors streak free.
Easy fix for no suction
Powerful for its size
I am very happy with its performance.
Powerful for its size.
Has the right accessories to get into corners and crevices.
Her housekeeper comes every other week, the dirt devil is great in between.
I do recommend it for an apartment space rather than for a large house, because the canister would need to be empty several times.
It is ideal for a quick refresh though, no matter what your square footage is.
I'm not sure what may have caused the problems for some of the low ratings; I only know that I like this machine.
It does what it's built to do; it's much lighter in weight than my old Eureka Boss that died last year; and it has tremendous suction power.
It doesn't matter if you pay several hundred dollars for an overpriced Dyson or a hundred for an inexpensive Hoover, Bissell, Eureka, Kenmore or whatever bagless machine.
I like being able to remove the bag, put it in the trash, put in a new bag and go on from there...with little dust getting away.
This vac picks it all up and darned well.
The pet-paw with it's suction-powered rotating blade does a great job on upholstery.
Since I have an old-fashioned brush from a discarded vac, I use it (it fits on the hose wand just fine) and get much better results.
For a solid, workmanlike vacuum you can hardly do better than this one.
We Love this Vacuum
Our price rage was less than $120, and this was the best option that we found.
Every one of the attachements work great, and it is easy to empty and clean.
Great suction power.Spring the extra $$ to get the auto retracting cord that this model includes.
It makes the closet seem so much cleaner.I would reccomend this product to a friend.
"VERY GOOD" Vacuum at a "GOOD" Vacuum price
Needless to say, here I was, almost 4 years later and still no new vac, I looked at other vacuums and was beginning to think that a "GOOD" was going to end up costing more than I wanted to spend for "GOOD" vacuum.
I saw one at Wal-mart, but it was still priced a little more than my budget was telling me I could spend for a vacuum.
After reading a couple of reviews, and it being priced right, I decided to buy it.
This vacuum turned out to be a "VERY GOOD" vacuum at "GOOD" vaxcuum price!
Nobody does it like you!
Best "stick" vacuum ever!
We've had this vacuum for over 2 years now and are on the original battery...still going strong.
We have thought about buying another battery (less than $50 now [...] ) because our kids love to vacuum with this vac and aren't as quick as we are.
It is so light-weight and easy to maneuver!
We highly recommend this vacuum.
Been through a bunch of vacuums and so far this is the best
I have a brand new vacuum (another popular brand) on my porch that is horrible.
It 'feels' better than others.
you can tell it's picking up dirt and it's easy to handle because it's fairly light weight.
It's also one of the only vacuum cleaners that has a hose/tube attached in a good location so it's easy to use.
So far, I'm really happy with it.Update: Bought this vacuum in the fall of 2011 and now it's June 2012 and I still love it!
I like it so much that I bought a second one so I can have one on each floor of my house.
It's fairly light weight, easy to use, easy to clean the dirt out, requires no replacement parts (belts or bags) and the hose is easy to use while you're cleaning.
The woman who cleans my husband's office actually has one too and she said it works great for her too.
best cordless stick vacuum
this absolutly the best cordless vacuum you can buy , light weight easy to use , plus you have a long running time & it has full power right up to the time it needs to be recharged and a very good suctsion , there are 2 different prices for this vacuum with the same model number & both look indenical , this is my second vacuum that i bought , the first one i paid the higher price , this time i bought the cheaper one saved about $45 dollars , and i can see no differents between them , you can also buy this model that is recondishend , if i need another vacuum i would try a recondishen one , they sell for about $80 , i also bought the small hand vacuum and like that one very much
I love it!!!!
A little vacuum with big power!
This is a great little vacuum cleaner!
I didn't really care if it did rugs very well, but it does a better job than my Oreck XL!It is light, and has a very flexible head so gets in all the tight spaces better than my Swiffer!There is a bit of a "new appliance" odor when you first start to use it, but it dissipates quickly.Thank you, everyone, for all the reviews you posted, which convinced me to buy this great item.
How foolish I would have been to miss out on such a wonderful purchase!
Thank you also to Amazon, for excellent service and price.
Batteries are great.
The charge on these batteries is good.
Well Worth the Money
I've always had good luck with this brand, and should have stayed with it.The vacuum has excellent suction power and seems to glide by itself, although it isn't a self-propelled vacuum.
Overall, you get a lot of bang for the buck with this vacuum.
The Hoover StemVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge arrived quickly.
While trying to potty train her, we were having to hand clean up all her accidents.The Hoover Stem Vac Carpet cleaner quickly cleaned up our carpets helping us to get rid of odors frompast accidents, helping to reinforce our training.
We are so glad to have the vac handy for those timeswhen hand cleaning just doesn't cut it.
wash the filters after every use and you wont have to buy another filter for atleast a year!I have 2 dogs, a husky and a golden, I also have a 3 y/o and a 14 y/o.
If you get sick of clogs in your vac, and inefficient overpriced vac's then get this one.
I am very sorry to see it go, and will be purchasing the same vac to replace it.
It was worth the $45 I paid for it, it does an amazing job on pet hair, and crumbs.
The onboard tools are great too, it goes under almost anything, and fits into pretty narrow spaces because it doesnt have a huge head on it.
you can also clean it easily, I always emptied the container and washed it out and the filter after every use, and check the line for any clogs.
its so small and compact and easy to store.
I bought this product to clean up small messes around the house that either weren't well suited for a broom or were in a confined enough area that the full sized vacuum cleaner wasn't going to work (i.e.
And it works great for those applications.The little flip out brush and pull out extended reach tube are very well thought out.
The motor is powerful and does a good job of picking up things as heavy as metal nuts if you get close enough.
You'll end up happier even if it runs you a few extra dollars....With that said I'm still going to rate the product 5 stars because its the best dust buster I've ever owned and its designed perfectly for how it is meant to be used.
If it breaks I would likely purchase another and will continue to recommend this model to friends.
a better "mouse trap" for quick clean-ups and no cumbersome cord.. the rotating brush makes the difference and pretty strong suction; removable handle great for stairs and cushions.
Two batteries a plus!
Great machine and deal!
I love Vac .
Lite to use but strong power.
The attachments work great.
Very easy to empty dust cup.
Wonderful Vacuum
I got the vacuum very fast and about broke my neck to open it.
I can't believe how well this thing picks up!
With this vacuum, one pass thru and the hair is gone!
And the pet brush works just as beautifully on my furniture!
What a great purchase!
Great Little Machine
I have two sets of carpeted stairs in my home, and cleaning them with the Dyson attachments is unwieldy, and using a cordless dustbuster seemed to not do anything at all.
I would say the suction rivals that of my Dyson.
(And I have a small dog, who isn't even allowed on the stairs)The Riser Visor is great, it allows me to get all angles of each stair with the spinning brushes, which let's face it, is the best way to clean.
The 20 ft. cord reaches easily from the nearest plug to the opposite side of the stairs...
Not a deal breaker, as I see I can buy a kit.I am going to use it in my car, and THEN, I am keeping this baby in my home office, to keep the dustbunnies behind my desk/computer at bay, and for the quick clean up when I empty the shredder bin.
When first got it the suction was great.
This thing SUCKS!!....and HOW!!
We put the full size (pipe) extension and floor piece from our upright and use this to do the floors in the house as well.A low cost portable cleaning machine..You will be amazed at the job this does on your stairs,...YOUR STAIRS ARE FILTHY..unless you own this vacuum!
This is our second HEPA vacuum cleaner--our earlier Hoover appears to be wearing out.
Clearly Shark learned from the mistakes the earlier vacuums made.
The Shark's canister only has a simple wire mesh filter on the central exhaust tube so there's nothing to clean when you empty the canister, making the whole process much less messy and more pleasant for me.The thick foam filter that leads to the motor is designed to be removed and washed every few months.
This makes the machine much quieter and reduces wear on vacuum and carpet when it's idling or when you're using the hose attachment.It's easy to detach the entire canister-hose-motor assembly from the floor sweeper base and use it as a canister vacuum.
This is really good as it knocks a lot of weight off and also leaves you with a cleaner unit to carry around if you're vacuuming cobwebs over your bed or something.When the extension hose is detached from the base, no air is sucked into the base so you don't have to worry about where you set the vacuum down when you're using the hose attachment.
You don't have to worry about vacuuming up toys with the floor unit while you're trying to vacuum cobwebs off the walls or ceiling with the hose.I initially thought the swivel base was a useless gimmick but I've decided it's quite helpful when you're vacuuming along a wall or near furniture and the handle/canister would otherwise be running into the wall.The hose brush attachment has a swiveling beveled joint with its intake tube, which means you can change the angle of the brush with respect to the hose.
Best stick vac yet
It has more suction, is lighter, and quieter, than any of its corded predecessors (Dirt Devil and can't recall the other).
Plus it cordless, stands upright all on its own, and can be used as a handheld for furniture and such.
Enough battery power for me to vac a large kitchen, entryway, and two bathrooms without any power loss or recharging.
This thing fits into the corner or one of the closets.-Filter access is super easy!
It's got 4 filters (bag, motor intake, motor exhaust, case exhaust) that are of varying types to catch any and everything that passes through it.-Rolls around very easy.First use reactions:-Soooo quiet!!
On max setting, it's still not half or a third as loud as any of my previous vacuums.
On the lowest setting, it still sucks up everyday grunge on the hardwood floors and doesn't freak my cats out.-Upward pointing exhaust in the MAIN reason I bought this thing and let me tell you, if you have pets, upward exhaust is the ONLY way to go!
You can now just vacuum everything up, where it's at without fear of having to calculate angles and vectors as to not blow garbage into places you don't want.-Hose, handle and head are well built and make the job easy and swift.
The hose doesn't kink on itself and all the hose connections rotate easily.-Works amazingly well on any hardwood surface.
We have 50yr old hardwood floors, high raised tile and small tile floors that it doesn't have a problem with.This thing just made obsolete my entire vacuum collection!
This vaccum sucks!!!!
I have both hardwood and carpet with 3 pets so this vaccum is wonderful!!!!
This is the best stick vac ive owned.
This might be a nice vacuum for someone living alone with very light vacuuming to do.
Should have bought this when my house was new
Man I'm glad i did, this vac is the best!!
Truly amazed at what was in my carpets and amazed that it made my carpets feel like new again.
no pets..buy this one!
Great for Pet Hair
For the most part they are wrong; you just have to maintain them.Since I am a collector, I did not buy this vacuum to be my only cleaner.
If you remember to change the belt on time (like any other vacuum) pet hair will be no problem.
It also removes a surprisingly large amount of grit, which is hard to find in this price range.
The dirt cup is very easy to empty as well.The turbobrush is best I have ever used.
Not enough to replace it, but quite bad for only a few hours of use.Considering what is sold today, the Cleanveiw is a good choice.
If you must buy a new department store vacuum under $100, this is the way to go.
Pleased with this product
So far, I'm very pleased with it's performance.
I would like it a bit quieter, but the suction is good.
I love the automatic cord wind up.
The Hoover stick works very well.
It has suficent suction to take care of some really tuff jobs.
The power head is strong and can handle any carpet that we have.
Love the ease of use.
Grab the Linx!
Grab the Linx Cleaner!
The Hoover Linx Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner couldn't be any more handy to use, and so easy to clean out the dirt cup.
I sure like the ease of cleaning a floor without having to bend over and hurt my back.I have an extra battery, so when one battery runs down, I just put it in the charger, put the already charged battery in and off I go again!I just can't say enough good things about this vacuum cleaner...everybody should have one.
BUY THIS VACUUM!
Simply as a handheld, it picks up phenomally well, and is simple to dump out.
), and suprisingly long cord (surprising by how compact it looks when wrapped), this thing makes me hear an angelic chorus.
This thing is crazy!!
!Another marvelous feature is the dual-motor system, which means you can turn the roller off and simply use it for a vacuum, which is great for when you're using the hose and don't want to waste the power, put wear on the belt, and have the roller wearing out whatever it happens to be sitting on.My only complaint, which is absolutely aesthetics: every picture you see, on Amazon, on the product box, and even on Eureka's website, shows a clear or smoke dust cup, which matches the color scheme of the upright we have.
It's light, easy to use for a quick pickup and easy to put away; with the collapsible handle it takes up very little space & can fit anywhere.
Easy to use, and empty.
Works great!
Has a lot of power.
Happy with it.
Great price, would recommend to anyone.
It works great on the carpets, I use it on the sofa and it is super for molding and the like.
I've started using my Wonder Washer again (2012) and it's been a real life saver especially when I'm about to run out of clean undies!
I'm saving money using this which is great since they just raised my rent again!I fill mine up in the bathtub and run it sitting on a memory foam bath mat on the floor.
I agree with everyone else that the lid is a joke, I use it is to prevent water from flying out of the bucket while its running and then to use it as a tray for my clothes to still rinse.I have had this little washer for years and it's still running strong!
It was definitely a wise investment.
My clothes are coming out very clean.When you push it up and down you can hear the air whoosh out the vent and feel the suction where it is pulling the water through the dirty clothes.
Only a couple minutes on wash and another minute on rinse and they are nice and clean.
Also, you use significantly less detergent than is required in a washer.
Smart Investment & LOVE MY PANDA
Easy set up, and very easy to use.
It washes your clothes out nice and clean just like a normal washing machine would.
You have to go through obviously on the rinse cycle, which I find easier to save the motor from any extra work, I use my hand held spray and rinse out my clothes that way and let it drain out....making sure all soap gets out.
I love my Panda as living in an apartment where we don't have washer & dryer hook-ups helps me keep up with my laundry needs and will eventualy pay for it's self in 2 months for me.
Where I was spending $50 a month just at the laundry mat, I won't miss doing that anymore trust me!
Works good.
Other than that, it's a good product overall.
My son is now 17 months and it still works great.
Perfect for the new parent in small apartment dwelling.
Well 800 gram isn't much weight, it's = to 1.25 pds which is basically the weight of the water you put in it, yes socks and underwear may not weigh that much when there dry, but they do when there wet, its a different ball game for it haha.
Sounded like the motor was whining up, (working hard) so it wasn't quiet I should say, quieter than a regular one but still, was kinda annoying to hear.
Excellent washer - I wish I had bought it sooner!
I've had this washer for about six weeks and I'm very happy with it.
Other laundry room hassles included the machines being always busy when I wanted them, and management having to constantly be reminded to empty the $%&*#@ quarters from the machines before they were so full they jammed.Anyway, the washer works great, arrived in perfect condition (and quickly!)
and was a breeze to connect to a spare bathroom sink.
But hose connection, after removing the faucet aerator, was very simple, with no leaks.Bottom line is, I'm quite pleased with the washer's performance (clothes get very clean, machine is quiet), the convenience, and no longer having to endure neighbors' cooties on my laundry.
Do a load or two each night to keep the stuff from building up and save big time.
I wash, manually, wring, rinse with fabric softener, wring again and hang or place on a folding rack  (bathtub in the winter, patio in the summer)  I now only have to visit that cash sucking laundramat for the big stuff.
I keep mine right by the kitchen sink and use it every day.
I was prepared to tell my sister that her surprise gift I bragged about so much, would be here by the 9th or 11th.This company is AAA+ fast.
I'm giving them the best babyshower gift based on the great reviews, and because I'm just a fabulous, thoughtful gift giver :) My sister may not have the luxury of a laundry room, but now she can do her newborn's laundry in the comfort of her apartment!
Great Buy and Works Well If Not Overloaded
I'm very pleased with this product and I'm sure you will be as well providing you don't confuse it with a full-size unit.The main reason I'm writing this is to mention, unlike the company's customer service department claimed, IT WILL work without being directly connected to a water source.
This little machine is a marvel.
It works perfectly.I just hook it up to the kitchen sink, wash the clothes,and hang them out on the patio and let the hot Texaswinds dry them.
They smell so fresh.
It doesn't take longbecause the spin basket does such a good job of re-moving the water.It is quiet, easy to lift and really gets the clothesclean.No more noisy,  crowded, dirty laundromats.
Nomore lugging heavy baskets out to the car.
LOVE THIS MACHINE!!!
I live on the third floor with no elevator and laundry was NOT fun.
I have a very small apartment and this machine fits perfectly under my counter in the bathroom.
It looks very neat, like a storage container and using it is very simple and easy.
It requires little soap and it really does great job getting clothes clean, I think better than the laundry mat, YOU can control how long you want things to wash,  If you spin the clothes longer they come out almost dry, I hang my clothes in the shower on hangers and overnight everything including towels get dry.
Aquarium tubing works great.
have not used it yet just got it today, but it looks like it is going to do the job.
Useful little machine
But for washing my clothing, this little guy really does a good job.Caveats:1)If you don't load enough items into it to - for lack of a better term - stabilize the water, when it gets going it can create what I like to call the whirlpool effect and slop water over the sides of the bucket.
Works like a charm.6)To save myself from getting arthritis from hand-wringing out the items (and to speed the drying time), I also got a spin dryer.
Works great.All in all a handy little apppliance.
good product
works good , very powerful tool for home use, especially for light clothes.
My wife and I are satisfied with tool.suggestion: the diameter of the hosepipe is too small, I cannot use it on my tapalso, I'm sensitive with the smell, if the smell is not so bad, I'll be happy with it.
I had no problems with the return.
The replacement works fine.
I absolutely love this product!
It's compact and works great for undergarments, gentle clothing with beading and dry clean only clothing.
Drawback you have to manually rinse out soap, but worth it.
I absolutely recommend this wonder washer.
Washes wonderful and spins out to just damp.
It came in about 5 days, much earlier than the esimated shipping date.
It hooked up easy and has no leaks, and doesn't play Jingle Bells, (LOL) like previous models!
It's perfect for 1-2 people in a small apartment, probably not the most paractical for a big family, but I love it.
And I make everyone that comes over, check-it-out, and they love it too!
Wonderful Little Washer
Not a problem worked as advertised out of box.No leaks, quiet, fast, able to spin handwashed items just good all around washer for the size.
wonderful machine
I am into RV living and this machine fits right in I have decided to give up the dining table it is just a catch all anyways and that gives me a spot for a laundry center the machine is much quieter than I expected and does a great job you will have to figure out the amount of detergent to use that all depends on the brand you use.
don't try to wash blankets but sheets work well I have washed two king size and they came out well.
After a year with this machine I still have no regrets it has paid for itself several times over.
This dryer is the perfect size for my motorhome and it works great with dryel.
Energy demand is low for drycleaning.
I like this washer a lot.
Any clothes with spandex I wash in this because the washing machines are too hard on them - then of course air dry.
I find this little spin dryer very handy, for hand washing and saving trips to the laundromat.
It works as advertised and is surprisingly quiet.
Love the machine.
Love the features!
NO MORE LAUNDRY DAY
This Little washer is great.Ive had it about two weeks and no problems.Its small, the casters are junk.I would leave the rubber mounts on.it is so light i can slide it to my sink in my apartment.dont overload this machine with heavy items.i work on cars for a living.when i put two pair of dirty work pants in they get clean but not as clean as just one with a pair of sox or a shirt.one pair of pants per load.does sheets great.just watch the machine it tends to get unbalanced with a heavier load.overall cant complain.the spin dry is really good i dont even have a dryer and my things usually dry overnight.very quite.worth the money.and who can beat free shipping.amazon rocks!!
For a year we've gone to a laundry mat with no A/C every week and spend $25-$30.
I kept seeing Haier brand and read all the reviews and decided to purchase them from home depot which was the best price and most well know website.
To sweeten the deal Home Depot had a discount offer at this time that got us $25.00 off our purchase which made the price cheaper than the other websites.
Hooking up the washer was super easy just connecting some hoses to the bathroom sink.
I was so surprised how much I could fit in one load.
The largest load it fit and washed perfectly was 3 of my husband's work jeans and 2 of my jeans.
In just 3 loads I had all my laundry done.
Also I used the Downey ball and it work perfectly!
Largest wash load took only about 45min.
I'm so sorry I waited so long to buy this washer, it works great and I'm very happy with the size and price.
Haier washing machine:$219.00, Price per YEAR to use:$38.00, Not wondering who washed their clothes in the washer before me and watching a homeless man eat from the trash while sitting in a laundry mat for over 2 hours: PRICELESS!!
The delivery was super quick...literally received it within one day of getting the shipping notification email.The funniest thing was when I noticed that the washer was still a little wet inside.
Once I re-read the instructions, I was able to get it in perfect with no spraying etc.
I use this washer with my kitchen faucet and it has worked great.
I have yet to experience any firefighter hose-like activity by doing just this.The washer itself is amazing.
The pros are an ongoing list, here are the most important to me:small and efficienthandles all types of clothingdoesn't leak water anywhereable to use any type of detergentquiet spin cycleI am a person who is super anal about my washing meaning I sort my clothes by color (yellow, red, light blue, dark blue, etc) not by just white and colors.
I was getting tired of lugging my clothes on the train and having to deal with people asking me for money at 3am.Getting a machine that was going to handle my craziness and my preteen son's ability to dirty every article of clothing he uses in one wear was important to me.
It gets everything clean in one wash...no need to rewash or prewash.The only con is that I had no idea this washer existed.
It is by far the best purchase I have made in a long time.
No more hauling my clothes on the train, laudromats or encounters with the money deprived night owls in my borough.
It's a Perfect Solution & I LOVE it!!!
This is one nifty little machine.
It's very easy to assemble and operate.
The casters do have flip locks on each wheel so make sure they are in the unlocked position for easy rolling.
The hoses are easy to connect and make sure you have pliers on hand for and extra snug fit.
It prevents the water leaks others complain about.
The included faucet adapter did not fit anything in my house properly HOWEVER the water hose hooks up to the end of a garden hose perfectly!!
The drain hose has to be at least 31 inches high and no more than 40 inches high (also according to the instructions).My final verdict....it's a wonderful little machine.
It's compact but does what the big boys does on a smaller scale.
I was amazed at how well it cleaned clothes.
The digital panel is easy to operate and I love the clear lid on top.If you do things right you should have a smooth setup and operation.
Read the instruction manual FIRST, it's not very long and simple to understand.
Great little machine
I bought this machine from another source, it IS cheaper here on Amazon though...anyway.
Easy to set up and works great!
Great buy
At this price this thing is well worth the money.
It doesn't get the little food stains out of my tees, but it does get everything else out: smells, grease, etc...
I feel that it is more gentle on my clothes and may make them last longer.
No more lugging my load of laundry into my car and then to the mat.
Perfect if you're a student or live in an apartment.
Also saves time: I think I can get a small load done in less than ten minutes; wash and rinse.
Also saves electricity by working off muscle-power.
2-in-1 tool, awesome!
Well I did, and I love it.
I switched to hand washing because when washing at laundry mat, I was breaking out after wearing my clothes.
This thing is great.
I can wash a tub of clothes now in less time and really get detergent out of my clothing.
It gets everything out of the clothing with less work compared to traditional hand washing.
Great product.
the washing machine at my place doesn't work half the time and i like washing my clothes by hand.. i also line living simple and i gave away alot of my clothes away so i just own boardshorts, undershirts, socks and work uniforms.. the reviews are all correct about this tool, it currants VERY good and it gets tough stains out :) i do recommend you go to ace hardware and buy a broom stick with metal screw part and replace the stock stock with it.. .
the best back pack washer
so it took some room to put it in the pack but if you plan to be awhile in the wilderness and don't want to pack a lot of clothes then take the washer and wash the ones you did pack.
That's every single day, without fail, sometimes even more then 2 loads.I live in an apt building where the laundry room in the basement was very small for all the tenants, and VERY expensive ($3 to wash $2 to dry).
Not only the fact that I was paying $5/load, I had to STAND IN LINE to get a washer as there are only 8 washers/dyers for a 20 floor building (dumb I know) and you dare not leave you clothing there.
I have no idea why we waited so long as this is a life saver!It washes better then the ones in the laundry room and since I don't pay utilities, it's free!
The only tim eyou can hear it is when it does a hard spin and if you can't handle 30 seconds of spinning then maybe you shouldn't own a washer.As for capacity, it's not that small!
So, it does fit a good amount for being a small washer and no, I never cram it full.I have NEVER had a leaking problem, but again, I dont cram it full, always make sure the connections are on well, use it on level ground... so basically I use it carefully and properly.
Never an issue as I never have, and never would, leave ANY washer running and go out.Anyway, I absolutely LOVE this machine and would buy another if this one dies before we move into a house!
This is a giant step up from hand washing as it really saves me time.
I do muscle training so the hand crank is really easy.
Coupled with the Centrifugal dryer it takes me a fourth of the time I used for handwashing before.
Just follow instructions and it works great!
I would say that ,for what I payed for it,the Wonderwash(er) is an excellent supplemental tool.I have mine on my kitchen counter and it is very useful as I am a single man who only sporadically can make it to the Laundromat.
Whether the clothes are actually very clean at the end of the process is up for discussion.I note a strong aroma of the detergent I use in them which I guess would eradicate any other smell.The only difficulty I can see is it's ability to wash out neck stain without an overnight soak...all in all I am not displeased with my purchase at all and I have owned it now for close to two years.
We loved the concept of being about to do laundry right at the cabin and not having to drive 40 miles, one way to a laundry mat.
For a bucket with a motor attached this is a get way to wash clothes.
I do all of my washing with it and my clothes come out whiter and fresher looking that they did when I went out and used large machines.
It does take some time to get your washing finished but I do it three to four times a week and it works out fine.
For one  person I think it is well worth buying.
This was the most useful thing that I have bought on the internet .
It washes the clothes really clean andis comparable to the bigger washers .
I can get more in there since it doesn't have an agitator .When my garagespigot busted I hauled that in my kitchen .
I love thatthing a lot .
There is so much that you can do with this little washer .
I have found this nifty item to be a life saver- I live on the third floor, don't have a car and it is very difficult for me to get to the laundrette all the time.
The only downside is  there is no draining, it has to be emptied in the sink, so the clothes are sopping wet when you are through- I have to leave them to drain for awhile before hanging- This would be absolutely perfect for a dorm room.
SHAMEFUL!The actual unit itself is a great concept--just pray you get a good one!
Great little washer - Love little washer !
This machine is a very good investment.
It has electronic controls, and gives a nice beep signal when the cycle is completed.
Regarding the noise while the cycle is going (IT'S VERY QUIET).
The hook-up instructions for this machine are simple.
Its great for a small family.
I thought I needed a large machine - but with this machine that's definitely not true - I'm so happy I didn't spend $700 or more on a washing machine!
It's able to wash full size sheets - (two or three sheets maximum at a time).
Rattles a bit with heavy items, but still a good buy!
Otherwise, it is a quiet spin.
I can still hear my tv, and spin dry at the same time.I wish it came with a longer hose though, instead of the extra connecting hose, which can be messy if not connected properly.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.
Essentially I just use it to toss around the diapers in the detergent and use my hand to agitate the diapers to get a better clean.
I have used the wonderwash for thin cotton tshirts and it worked fine.
Overall I give 4 stars because I bought it for diapers and am successfully cleaning poop and pee from them on a daily basis with no staining or smells.
I think this comes partly from a good detergent (Rockin green) but the wonderwash is part of the system as well.
Happy with my purchase
very good looking but performs terribly...
we bought this particular model and oh man when it came were we excited.... it looked absolutely gorgeous, modern, and top of the line.
Works exactly as advertised
They do come out cleaner though, and for small bits of laundry, like underwear, socks or polos, it works just fine and they do not take too long to dry.I did not find any of the materials to be cheaply made whatsoever.
Simply by looking at the parts, it is easy to see how they all fit together.
