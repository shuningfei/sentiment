pos		pos		automatically 		this is a welcome change once again from having to brush the paper filter on our hoover every time i emptied the canister the floor sweeper brush runs on a separate motor from the vacuum motor , which means you can manually switch the floor brush off while vacuuming , and the brush is only running when you pivot the handle down to do the actual vacuuming when it 's just idling upright the brushes turn off automatically 
pos		pos		cavity 		they usually cost at least 3x a standard consumer model , which was a bit daunting until our most recent consumer microwave developed a hole in the rear of the cavity

pos		pos		gift 		awesome gift 
pos		pos		improved 		we tried cleaning the gears in the back on several occasions , but it never improved 
pos		pos		worst purchase 		trouble is , for the price , it 's one of the few toasters that can do two bagels at once or a long piece of homemade bread as long as you keep in mind that it might need replacing in a year or so , it 's not the worst purchase 
pos		pos		made 		this toaster is very cheaply made 
pos		pos		product 		great product

pos		pos				product works great 
pos		pos		choose to keep 		worse comes to worse you can take out the 6 d batteries that should last for years if the kiddies figure out the on off button but that 's unlikely it has a stay open button as well , for those busy occassions and , they both stay as clean as you choose to keep them because it 's so easy to hit the mark every time !

pos		pos		more upsides 		the other 1200 watt microwaves need three or more upsides 
neg		neg		history 		the handle melted , the toaster oven was history 
pos		pos		ammo to go 		i decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews it generally works as described the main annoying thing \( which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan \) is it appears to have a 15 20 second after use pause so if you put something in , and immediately want to throw something else away , you either have to wait what seems like forever , or open it by hand my previous sensor can would immediately open again if i went to it again within 1 3 seconds 
pos		pos		up 		the pan seems to be fairly non stick and easy to clean up 
pos		pos		star 		the only thing is the attachment always falls off , the extra brush they give you , so i took off a star

pos		pos		! 		the best gadget ever ! ! ! 
pos		pos		down and snap 		why not just make a lid that closes and seals without having to push it down and snap it \? i'm sure all these things except for the first make it a technically great tasting cup of coffee , but for me , the average jane , just wanting a quick cup of joe it 's a few too many steps for me to enjoy fully maybe i'm just too cranky before i get my first cup \? 
neg		neg		extension hose lifts 		it does n't bother me but it drives my wife nuts the extension hose lifts off either as a short hose or a long hose depending on where you unclip it from the base

pos		pos				hot damn , this shit makes my morning 
pos		pos		compared to starbucks 		it takes 30 minutes to complete cons 1 \) to make relatively strong coffee you need to keep the settings on extra strong coffee and grind the beans very fine \( there is a setting for that on the grinder \) 2 \) coffee comes out warm hot , but not very hot , so if you plan to add milk from the refrigerator , warm it in the microwave3 \) espresso is not really that strong , compared to starbucks or dunkin donuts , even on the highest settingoverall , i would highly recommend this espresso machine to people who want something fancier than a regular coffee maker or keurig , but also want to keep it simple from the point of putting an effort to make a cup of coffee feel free to ask any questions
