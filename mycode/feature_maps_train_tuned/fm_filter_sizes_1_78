pos		pos		can manually switch 		this is a welcome change once again from having to brush the paper filter on our hoover every time i emptied the canister the floor sweeper brush runs on a separate motor from the vacuum motor , which means you can manually switch the floor brush off while vacuuming , and the brush is only running when you pivot the handle down to do the actual vacuuming when it 's just idling upright the brushes turn off automatically 
pos		pos		3x a standard 		they usually cost at least 3x a standard consumer model , which was a bit daunting until our most recent consumer microwave developed a hole in the rear of the cavity 
pos		pos		i erroneously assumed 		read many reviews before buying this product \( including consumer reports flawed high rating \) and now , after using it , i am quite amazed of the overly positive writings this has received positives knives are well balanced , not very heavy , blades are sharp \( although they need to be honed every time after being used to keep them sharp \) , bamboo quality finish look is great , and product carries mfr 's limited life warranty ! negatives there is a lot to say upon first visual contact one can easily tell this is not a japanese made product \( i erroneously assumed so !

pos		pos		previous sensor trashcan 		i decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews it generally works as described the main annoying thing \( which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan \) is it appears to have a 15 20 second after use pause so if you put something in , and immediately want to throw something else away , you either have to wait what seems like forever , or open it by hand my previous sensor can would immediately open again if i went to it again within 1 3 seconds 
pos		pos		stick and easy 		the pan seems to be fairly non stick and easy to clean up

pos		pos		keep the settings 		it takes 30 minutes to complete cons 1 \) to make relatively strong coffee you need to keep the settings on extra strong coffee and grind the beans very fine \( there is a setting for that on the grinder \) 2 \) coffee comes out warm hot , but not very hot , so if you plan to add milk from the refrigerator , warm it in the microwave3 \) espresso is not really that strong , compared to starbucks or dunkin donuts , even on the highest settingoverall , i would highly recommend this espresso machine to people who want something fancier than a regular coffee maker or keurig , but also want to keep it simple from the point of putting an effort to make a cup of coffee feel free to ask any questions
