pos		pos		gripe with this 		\) i have had just minor issues with balancing the knife a few times and found if i adjust how i lay it on the plate \( either put more handle on the plate or set it on vertically \( either blade up or down \) it works , but because of the design , you can easily set the knife back on the table standing with its blade down , because the business part of the blade does not touch the table to those who have rust problems not due to misuse , have you attempted to contact henckels re the lifetime warranty \? my only gripe with this product is that henckels does not make this set for 12 and 23 piece sets for 4 are available at very few places including just a small percentage of bed bath beyond stores

pos		pos		much higher pricing 		the maximum thickness of the blade \( not the cutting edge \) is thicker than a traditional , quality japanese knife \( such as the sandoku \) and that alone plays a major role in the quality of cutting \( the thinner the blade , past the cutting edge , a more precise cut is attained and thus the higher the quality of the cut \) i used a high magnification microscope to examine eveness smoothness of the blade 's cutting edge and was amazed at the plethora of not only imperfections but also extensive 'chipping' which definately leaves the edge uneven and has a negative effect on the quality of cuts in the past i have examined other japanese style chef knives and could barely detect any such adverse characteristics the difference of course on those knives is their much higher pricing \( about 5 to 1 ratio \) than the pricing of the ginsu knives
