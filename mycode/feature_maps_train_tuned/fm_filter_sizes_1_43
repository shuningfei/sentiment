pos		pos		the base price 		it is a notable difference , and i guess there is more to brewing coffee than just showering grounds with hot water perhaps cuisinart has made improvements to the product over time , because the unit functions fine and cleans easily , though how it holds up over time remains to be seen and now , retailers have just cut the base price from 99 99 to 79 99 , and with a 20 off bed , bath beyond coupon , we 're talking about a 64 dollar machine that looks great and brews a rich , smooth cup of coffee

pos		pos		hardwood surface 		the hose does n't kink on itself and all the hose connections rotate easily works amazingly well on any hardwood surface 
neg		neg		cup \) 		it took a couple tries to find the water level that resulted in an egg that way i like it \( i prefer the yoke completely cooked but still orangish and not hard , in my machine that equals a splash over the medium line in the cup \)

pos		pos		microwave3 \) espresso 		it takes 30 minutes to complete cons 1 \) to make relatively strong coffee you need to keep the settings on extra strong coffee and grind the beans very fine \( there is a setting for that on the grinder \) 2 \) coffee comes out warm hot , but not very hot , so if you plan to add milk from the refrigerator , warm it in the microwave3 \) espresso is not really that strong , compared to starbucks or dunkin donuts , even on the highest settingoverall , i would highly recommend this espresso machine to people who want something fancier than a regular coffee maker or keurig , but also want to keep it simple from the point of putting an effort to make a cup of coffee feel free to ask any questions
