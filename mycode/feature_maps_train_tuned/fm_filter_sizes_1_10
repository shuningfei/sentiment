pos		pos		extremely poor product 		control i purchased the cuisinart because of the wattage power and the reviews however , not having an interior light is really an extremely poor product design seriously that is not why i gave it 3 stars , but does add to it i am more than rather disappointed in the fact that it does not cook consistently example i like baking sweet potatoes in the toaster oven with the thought in mind that the potatoes are the same size , sometimes it takes an extra 15 20 minutes i never ever had this problem with my delonghi

pos		pos		welcome change once 		this is a welcome change once again from having to brush the paper filter on our hoover every time i emptied the canister the floor sweeper brush runs on a separate motor from the vacuum motor , which means you can manually switch the floor brush off while vacuuming , and the brush is only running when you pivot the handle down to do the actual vacuuming when it 's just idling upright the brushes turn off automatically

pos		pos		sturdy 		comparing to the previous reviews , the forks are actually real sturdy 
pos		pos		pleasant for me 		the shark 's canister only has a simple wire mesh filter on the central exhaust tube so there 's nothing to clean when you empty the canister , making the whole process much less messy and more pleasant for me the thick foam filter that leads to the motor is designed to be removed and washed every few months

pos		pos		a favor and 		do yourself a favor and do not buy this ! 
pos		pos		strong ! 		i agree with everyone else that the lid is a joke , i use it is to prevent water from flying out of the bucket while its running and then to use it as a tray for my clothes to still rinse i have had this little washer for years and it 's still running strong ! 
pos		pos		nope 		nope

pos		pos		love it ! 		i love it ! ! 
pos		pos		easier if connected 		admittedly , it 's easier if connected to a water line but not that much trouble to fill manually here 's how i do it fill the tub up with water , add detergent , stir the water to mix , add clothes

neg		neg		actually does keep 		btw be sure to empty the crumb tray once in a while , as it actually does keep the crumbs in , and if you get a big pile going , that can affect toaster performance 
pos		pos		started leaking 		it just recently started leaking 
neg		neg		bit after you 		i assembled the whole thing in about 5 minutes or less a tip that i 've found , which i think a few others have posted as well , would be to let the clothes soak for a bit after you spin them around and before you rinse

pos		pos		highly recommend this 		it takes 30 minutes to complete cons 1 \) to make relatively strong coffee you need to keep the settings on extra strong coffee and grind the beans very fine \( there is a setting for that on the grinder \) 2 \) coffee comes out warm hot , but not very hot , so if you plan to add milk from the refrigerator , warm it in the microwave3 \) espresso is not really that strong , compared to starbucks or dunkin donuts , even on the highest settingoverall , i would highly recommend this espresso machine to people who want something fancier than a regular coffee maker or keurig , but also want to keep it simple from the point of putting an effort to make a cup of coffee feel free to ask any questions
