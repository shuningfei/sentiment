pos		pos		the potatoes are 		control i purchased the cuisinart because of the wattage power and the reviews however , not having an interior light is really an extremely poor product design seriously that is not why i gave it 3 stars , but does add to it i am more than rather disappointed in the fact that it does not cook consistently example i like baking sweet potatoes in the toaster oven with the thought in mind that the potatoes are the same size , sometimes it takes an extra 15 20 minutes i never ever had this problem with my delonghi

pos		pos		paper filter on 		this is a welcome change once again from having to brush the paper filter on our hoover every time i emptied the canister the floor sweeper brush runs on a separate motor from the vacuum motor , which means you can manually switch the floor brush off while vacuuming , and the brush is only running when you pivot the handle down to do the actual vacuuming when it 's just idling upright the brushes turn off automatically
