coffeemachine		coffeemachine		espresso machine to 		it takes 30 minutes to complete cons 1 \) to make relatively strong coffee you need to keep the settings on extra strong coffee and grind the beans very fine \( there is a setting for that on the grinder \) 2 \) coffee comes out warm hot , but not very hot , so if you plan to add milk from the refrigerator , warm it in the microwave3 \) espresso is not really that strong , compared to starbucks or dunkin donuts , even on the highest settingoverall , i would highly recommend this espresso machine to people who want something fancier than a regular coffee maker or keurig , but also want to keep it simple from the point of putting an effort to make a cup of coffee feel free to ask any questions
