three things that are disappointing
already rusted
really odd
drains down
great
inconveniences
which is an issue
few cons
Cons
not very hot
not really that strong
may not compare
two minor issues
shaken loose and leak
does not have

Too bad
Too bulky

incredible
the three models I had (including one replacement) failed in exactly the same manner
Failed again
bad
disposable
half the price
didn't even know it was legal
SO unfair
BEWARE
not there
couldn't care less
you're out of luck

At first I was reluctant

CONS
does not work very well
NOISY
only one middling complaint

So damn funny
cannot believe anyone doesn't know
Not what I was hoping for
only used once
unable to use it again

NEGATIVES
NOT
inferior
thicker than
plays a major role
amazed at the plethora of not only imperfections
uneven
negative effect
other adverse quality issues
annoying trait
HORRIBLE
very-very prone
how easily and quickly
will not prevent the abhorring
unbeleivably HORRIBLE
will have stains all over

well
not recommend
lies
just not true
become dull
get exactly what you pay for
inferior
should be ashamed
could barely detect any such adverse characteristics
highly-stained
crappy
old
smudgy
way more expensive
cooked-up
manufacturing
There is a lot to say
get what you pay for
flawed high rating
quite amazed of the overly positive writings
only wish I could get
probalby will never use
Great if you like RUSTY
not great
not the sharpest
biggest problem
pretty much started rusting immediately

These are not
cheaper version
save yourself the hassle and your money
Worst knives ever
crap

Don't waste your time or your money
I am not even kidding you
Not as impressed as others

no tactile feel
few drawbacks
Cons
biggest complaint

only drawbacks
little bit more of a hassle
heat things too much
no quality
Needed Repair
Never again
Error H98
Problem
lot of effort
too much
I've been a Panasonic fan for years until I purchased this microwave
never base a purchasing decision on brand name again
bit noisy
incorrect
little longer
we'll be selling this
larger
higher wattage
little too small
just barely fit
as far as functionality goes
wish it were a little more powerful
stopped working
does not
I'm afraid they put everything into the looks and not the works
Too bad
It's a little on the noisy side
no control over
no power control
stupid
very mediocre
stupid
Not as quick
wish there was
stupid
doesn't document this feature very well
It would be way cool
don't document that
stupid
could easily be so much better
biggest shortcoming
only reason I did not give it 5 stars
not sure
how enormous
doesn't seem to cook any faster
less
little long
only negative
some complaints about
shipment no
broken off
you get what you pay for
Died within 4 months
cheap
barely made it 4 months
huge difference
learned my lesson
GARBAGE
garbage
Less than two months after I received it from Amazon.com it failed
generates NO heat
problem
will not accept
doesn't even mention
doesn't seem to be
piece of CRAP
DO NOT BUY THIS
terrible
was a little skeptical
we just wish
only negative
really quite difficult
would have been more convenient
avoid having
rather loud
isn't five-star-perfect
Terrible
Don't Buy
quit working
not worth the wait
wish I would just go buy another one
will not be purchasing another
Wish I would have just bought
Its tough these days living without
couldn't help but to think they knew there was a problem
can't believe this is the quality
big
Never Buy Panasonic again
initially we were really pleased
after about 8 months the magnatron went out
should last a lot longer than
Unbelievable
we were without a microwave for 2 weeks
Dead after 4 months
Really weird
Hope I did not
lasted close to 20 years
failed much sooner
cost at least 3X
bit daunting

hard to
Worst of all
quit working
not honor
lasted over 10 years
expected to get at least 5 years out of this one, not just one year
not enough
keep the booklet handy every time I use it
would prefer
you must schedule 2 minutes and stand by to stop it at 1:30
Small downside
show fingerprints
more regular cleaning is required
Two problems
very disappointed
just got a lemon
whirring sound
HAD to take it in for warranty repair
would make for much quieter
did not have a microwave for the 2 weeks of warranty repair
problem
stopped heating
back at
two problems
not had the unit available for use for a month
Very disappointing
expensive
only minor issues
hard to see
nothing on the display to indicate that the oven is indeed cooking
BUYER BEWARE
Faulty
TERRIBLE
never order another Panassonic product in my life

Unevan Cooking
Loud

not the major complaint
never had a microwave cook as unevenly and this one
donate it to the Good Will

You can prepare 2 exact meals and one will come out over cooked, and the other one will come back lukewarm
ruined meal
broke
after return window expired
Won't recommend
broken just after return window expired
Lacking
doesn't' have that many fancy

NOTHING looks better than

Just like other cheap
will rub off over time
WAY too
pathetically short
Don't buy
avoid at all costs
Worst excuse
means nothing anymore
cruddy
certainly more expensive than
won't be expecting it to last a lifetime
complaints about meat dripping into the egg are valid
Waste

I'm in the process in getting a refund
minds well forget
will hate U
always expect frustration, rage and tears
junk
Replace it as soon as you can
would be nice
Caveats
don't fit
don't do well
stops working
don't want to have to change out the water more than necessary

had to send the 1st order back
Drawback
probably not the most paractical
don't try
