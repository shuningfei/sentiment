very mediocre
things went down hill pretty quickly
really cheap looking
noisy
very disappointed
not better
available at very few places
definitely wished we had gone with
shorten the life
very short
doesn't seem to be
serious junk
problem was same
another problem
toy
Very disappointed
less than elegant
didn't like
so dim it is difficult to read
not enough
does not even give you the option
3 stars
PASS ON THESE
only real flaw
not what I received
does not pick up very much
end up happier
too bad
wrong
not really that strong
Does not toast evenly
inconveniences
little slower
doesn't exactly save
Horrible
You can prepare 2 exact meals and one will come out over cooked, and the other one will come back lukewarm
didn't even know it was legal
not be happy
better off
incorrect
not as large
useless
Strangely uneven
complaints
does not come out quite far enough
can't believe I paid this much
joined my other "stuff" that hasn't worked out in my basement
pretty cheap
funky
Biggest drawback
immediately open again
healthier
few cons
biggest issue
NEGATIVES
not stay down
no method
unbeleivably HORRIBLE
suppose to
quite bad
Do Not Buy
not great
would never buy this international chinese junk again
if it's Cusinart, it's gotta be good
don't get it
One star
not recommend
folgers coffe can
These are going back
find it really cheap at our next garage sale
won't be expecting it to last a lifetime
less than useful
bent
Semi successful, but a pain
Does not toast evenly
won't take it back
much less expensive
terrible
stopped working
required only two
only difficulty
quite annoying
can't get the lever to come up
complaints about meat dripping into the egg are valid
low grade
going in the trash
very low
doesn't really close well
little yucky
NOISY
came washing off
piece of CRAP
cruddy
broken OUT OF THE BOX
joke
being shipped back
inconvenience
no room
Replace it as soon as you can
solid
hates
get a cheaper
wish the attachment had a brush for dusting
very concerned
generates NO heat
not being able
marginal at best
very loud and winy
look flimsy plastic
inclined to return
all aesthetic
little smaller than
little dark
we'll be selling this
bakes everything instead of toasting
like a little ghost kid is messing with it
not the direction of change that I expected
only did work for a total of 8 weeks
someone I dislike very much
seem more substantial
no interior pail
as far as functionality goes
:(
best isn't self propelled like
not what i thought
would be more accessible
complete waste
don't buy
Slightly disappointing
Gimped
not working
defective
highly recommend ...why I now have no idea
have to "jimmie" it
NOT CLEARLY VISIBLE
Return
slight downgrade
not the major complaint
BUT I found it did not toast evenly
stops working
unfortunate
embarassing
NOT as advertised
Doesn't feel substantial
don't know why Hamilton Beach hasn't fixed it yet
biggest problem
touch elusive
little uneven
not sure what the problem is
did not work
little difficult to maneuver
plenty of nooks and crannies to clean
performed more like
did not have a microwave for the 2 weeks of warranty repair
only fit
lot of effort
inconsistent
SHAMEFUL
SO unfair
apalling
ALL the condensation goes directly back into
nothing but trouble
rust problems
you get what you pay for
shameful
dramatically superior
little frustrating
does not have
never had any other type of beverage holder breaks so easily
very inconsistent
would like it a bit quieter
looks the same
slower pour compared to
you must schedule 2 minutes and stand by to stop it at 1:30
just barely fit
bit noisy
slowly turning
AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Little Disappointing
room for improvement
Feh
missing
used to it a little warmer
recommendation
expected to get at least 5 years out of this one, not just one year
Don't Buy
doesn't fit properly
negative
thought this would be a great
wasted
have to manually push
enough to knock off a star
Faulty
splattered
no means
Badly
Find something
can be messy
would be fine
HAD to take it in for warranty repair
lukewarm
cheap looking
worst part
not polished
could barely detect any such adverse characteristics
messy
very loud
junk
Don't be a sucker and buy
misleading
It's going back
threw me off
don't work either
better off getting
not really much use
one of the worst
biggest complaint
look rusty
like to return
returning
slightly faded
must be a better choice
open and close NON STOP
probably better
if you like cheap tacky looking things, you are going to love
Very loud
buzzing so loud
never happened with
none of it worked
I initially thought the swivel base was a useless gimmick
no tactile feel
still "reviewing" our case
noisy
nothing wrong
wouldn't be worth much more
can't really see it working well
big mistake
over sensitive
don't want to have to change out the water more than necessary
intimidating at first
Cheap
spill a lot of
stopped working
lacks the level of control I need
really should be
little less than 3/4's full
probably spill on
Dissapointed
hazardous
Should have gotten a different
fragile
pretty badly
damaged
Thanks
bit more noise
Not what I was hoping for
tells her there's nothing wrong
total shame
a bit of a joke
little wierd
not very consistent
not full flushed
wasn't working
just terrible
have to do this each time
no response
probably not the most paractical
wouldn't give this to my worst enemy
fell victim to the 'no suction' syndrome
not going to work
not function properly straight
few too many steps for me to enjoy fully
does not weigh much
only minor issues
puffed up to an extreme
only descent henkels come from
NOT GOOD ENOUGH
can't set
not enough
wasn't worth
SMALL
extremely poor
does not work
no room
don't show spots
dont buy
Any semi-advanced usage means consulting
so poor
Coarse
not easy to spot
spill most of the time
negatives
was amazed
never has the right time
need to dump it twice a day
Lesson learned
not great
Lacking
wrong
huge difference
weaknesses
bowed out
not hot enough
very loud, tinny
flaw
only gripe
pour off the lid onto your counter
couldn't help but to think they knew there was a problem
does not completely close
very disappointed
strange
These are not
Very disappointed
doesn't hold
wrong
not on the side edges or front like
be carefull
much smaller than
pretty short
does not lift out without some strange
may not compare
I'm in the process in getting a refund
little awkward
two small problems
barely made it 4 months
worn looking
did not like
could break something
non-retro
Tacky
Broke
Small downside
probably have issues
drips
threading' slivers
:(
a bit slow
Too bulky
only negative
must be something better
Loud
extremely difficult
not there
Not happy
caught fire
didn't want to pay
kind of a pain
Could Be Better
Won't recommend
hate that I spent good money on this
after about 8 months the magnatron went out
PLEASE!PLEASE!PLEASE!, save your money
no practicality
wilted
minds well forget
didn't get what i expected
only negative
shuts off directly
distraction
Worse
a bit pricey
nothing on the display to indicate that the oven is indeed cooking
cheap, light, feel
more than 5 pounds
2.5 stars
hard to see
only used once
drains down
Don't loose
15 seconds too long
We got two years
still going strong
any complaint
Cannot recommend
Missing
still no resolution
dreadful
not recommend
makes getting the "perfect toast" impossible
bad news
doesn't even mention
Not as quick
we were without a microwave for 2 weeks
save yourself the frustration
Feel like Im waisting money
would not turn on immediately
Beware
bloody
load of trash
disappointing drivel
energy-waster
Did realize that was asking so much
not properly alligned
don't get the same result
does not toast evenly
Never Buy Panasonic again
longer than
lasted close to 20 years
doesn't taste well
Worst excuse
wasn't really an easy way
BEWARE
2 stars
basically worthless
wet
Don't Buy
Dead
if it worked properly
broke in less than
broken off
needs to be emptied every room
not replaceable
really a waste
Less than two months after I received it from Amazon.com it failed
not repairable
tend to get unbalanced
probably wouldn't buy it again
never base a purchasing decision on brand name again
isn't as easy
not as good
little too small
broken from the get go
a bit louder than
malfunctions constantly
Doesn't toast evenly ever
only drawbacks
bought whatever they had for under $15
not a big
have to wait what seems like forever
go with one
rust already
Doesn't hold
canceled
could find this exact one in
most difficult part
threw the toaster out
bit priceier
did not even stop
7 amp not 12
Nope
Pathetic
Dim
narrow
shutting off immediately
look elsewhere
little disappointing
never happened before
Beware
didn't work
quite nicely
took nothing at all to break
leaving
still going strong after 15 years
looking for
probalby will never use
TERRIBLE
MUCH smaller than
sad
Very disappointed
Doesn't Pop up easily
jerk
just not true
much longer than needed
smaller than I thought
impossible
avoid at all costs
more wowed than 3 stars' worth
headache
only thing keeping this from a 5 star review
:-(
should really reconsider
have to either close it manually
major issue
barely do the job
won't turn on
never improved
SUCKS
not perfect
so loved
don't have to change
was afraid
impossible
Hate
really odd
Wish I had read other reviews
Failed again
What more could you asked for... Oh I know
get what you pay for
you'll have a flood
Seems kind of spendy
won't suction anything
sometimes it comes out without
Two problems
can't distinguish
rancid
died completely
irritating beyond belief
really quite difficult
bit daunting
did not take
go for the extra
awful
never used
doesn't seem to like to stay where it is supposed to
discolored
few drawbacks
not working
tends to dry out the toast too much
doesn't document this feature very well
split
don't like
If I knew it I would have not bought it
can not get a piece of white bread to toast EVENLY
seriously flawed
became a big deal
send us more
awkwardness
broken just after return window expired
larger than I would like
took the loss
some complaints about
(+_+)
Not good
different ball game for it
don't see it replacing
Big mistake
broke in half
Defective
no idea why this is recommended
poor performers
the same or lower than
be a challenge
much better at cleaning
complete waste
no Domo face
unable to use it again
junk
too bad
cheaper version
So much
should be ashamed
always expect frustration, rage and tears
worked flawlessly
Except
negative
never worked properly
only downsides
more regular cleaning is required
splattered
terrible
expect consistency
save your money
shocked
much worse
never ever had this problem
absolutely tweaky
show fingerprints
actively recommend against
pray you get a good one
fingerprint magnet
too much
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
poor
two problems
not recommend
wish it came with a longer
does not make
AWFUL
Don't like
the three models I had (including one replacement) failed in exactly the same manner
raise the lid for no apparent reason
Trouble
burns everything
whirring sound
rattled a bit too much
how bad
Junk
wasn't explicit enough
only downside
don't fit real cleanly
not smell-proof
without being paid
damaged
will have stains all over
dislike
mangled
little thin
we are suffering
Terrible
wouldn't pop up all the way
crease
huge pain
ran too quickly
rather loud
not perfect
guess not
poor
narrow
soooooo leaky
Perplexing
don't do well
a bit too sharp
Breaks easily
caught on fire
flaw
highly-stained
only wish
be barely cooked
plays a major role
they proved they can do the opposite
isn't reliable
NOT
pooped out
It's a little on the noisy side
kicking the thing
won't get it
heat things too much
how enormous
no matter what I do
Hard to figure out
start fuming
only thing that gives me pause
you will be disappointed
hard to see
At first I was reluctant

Extremely flimsy
similarly priced

Very surprising
left with streaks of rust
GARBAGE

I'm afraid they put everything into the looks and not the works
lasted over 10 years

Drawback
dangerous
don't like

not quite hot enough
wouldn't spend this much money
not very hot
awful
great deal of work
cost at least 3X
ordered an entirely different brand
does not close very smoothly
Burn hazard !!!!
complaints
creating a fire hazard
cumbersome
never going to use them without
done faster
Problem
quite short
doesn't work either
not judge a book.... by its cover
recommends
very flimsy
Really weird
looking for a new
negative effect
Had I seen this in a store, I'd have passed on
do not work properly
pretty bad
Dead after 10 months
necessitating a time-consuming cleanup
only one middling complaint
faulty
not the sharpest
doesn't say anything
was hoping that they would slice better than
will rub off over time
bad taste
would have given it five stars
dangerous result
Extremely Disappointed
Save your money
will hate U
wish I would just go buy another one
getting out of alignment
meh
not pop microwave popcorn properly
might prefer
showed spots after a couple of washings
couple of other complaints
Unbelievable

fairly big
nothing special

A lot more reliable

only thing I can complain
Beware
another inconvenience

headsup
don't document that
one big gripe
Underpowered

DON'T BUY IT

amazed at the plethora of not only imperfections
Be Careful
Save your money
only negative
not quiet
not sure
awful
No good
AWESOME
pathetically short
Thanks for nothing
Doesn't work
burned out
concerned
had a blister on my finger
dull unsharpable
don't buy
poor
silly
no longer stayed
slightly overpriced
after return window expired
BIGGER HEADACHE THEN THEY'RE WORTH
One other issue
should have been included
more than rather disappointed
not honor
too much
Would not recommend
Only problem
pseudo-analog
quick to break
dangerous glass breaking
not usable
just got a lemon
didn't find that these knives were nearly as sharp as I'd expected
only thing is a i wish it was a little bit bigger
expected the best
isn't built that well
complete waste
broke right in half
Leaked
could smell fumes
leaks at least a cup or two on to the counter
absolutely not worth
so narrow
failed
not 91yr old user friendly
incorrect
trusted
pure junk
used up batteries very fast
not the same quality
Junk
must be dirtier
blazes so bright it lights up the *adjacent* room at night
tasted horrible
might be a little overkill
sliding

extra 15-20 minutes
be problematic
hyper sensitive
nevermind
turned out weird
pretty flimsy
Leaks,Leaks,Leaks
didn't think it was worth
wish it were a little more powerful
very shaky
crumpled
possible bad
negatives
20 yrs

Dead after 4 months
only reason I did not give it 5 stars
don't think it was worth
I am sorry I did not read
shipment no
not worth the wait
MANY MANY burned
always drips
very noisy
don't get this
can't even pick up
very uneven
bursting into flames
No response
very hard to remove
would burn
will not accept
worthless
would have been more convenient
not so good
could buy an entire coffee maker for the price
hands down
smudgy
NOT a dog-proof
never keeps the elements on
Terrible
stay far, far, another galaxy away
Caveats
C'mon
weak
save yourself the hassle and your money
little short
two drawbacks
little difficult
laugh very hard
Worst of all
Hope I did not
still good
replaced them
avoid having
Its tough these days living without
would like to be able
you're out of luck
quite amazed of the overly positive writings
very short
not accurate
very hard
total loss
already dirty
means nothing anymore
just as dirty
OHHH, to have my old one back
Died within 4 months
what ever happened to "the customers always right?"
disposable
truly surprised someone would manufacture something so utterly useless
regret
inconvenient
makes it look much bigger than
bit small
very unevenly
Frustrated
little long
Needed Repair
smartly went out
Sketchy
incredible

Waste

lingering
little bit more of a hassle
festering
Wish I would have just bought
little weird
missing
don't fare very well
did not fit
cheap tacky looking
just a small
started leaking
don't tell me I just wasted money
only thing is the attachment always falls off
couldn't be read
dribbler
had some nice
Don't waste your time or your money
only available
still surprised
has more plastic parts than I prefer
get stuck
had to send the 1st order back
NOTHING looks better than
a bit small
CONS
annoying thing
should last a lot longer than
enough to require a towel and make you mad
shows smuges/fingerprints easily
avoid
higher wattage
feel like they might break
never reaches
don't like
can be interesting
nothing
$30 for 4 really
too much
rusted after one use
isnt even good
not the easiest
Not me
defective
INCONVENIENT
never buy Cuisinart again
absolute waste
cost a little more
Annoyingly WAY-TOO-NOISY
how easily and quickly
really good
have to nuke it
not powered
flaw
so disappointing
WAY OVERLY SENSITIVE
Not useful

HIGH-VOLUME-NOISE
It would be way cool
don't know what went wrong
few minor exceptions
need to buy
So damn funny
Stopped dead after 10 months use
perplexed
Disappointing
Don't buy
added 10 more minuets to taking out
Beware
MITE BIGGER
only wish I could get
MUST hold
wish there was
suspect
who needs a temporary
should have gone
confusing
drips all over the floor
initially we were really pleased
reduction
return this after this week
poor
Expensive
There is a lot to say
THE BEST
takes up a lot
returning
disposable
can pop off
*not* a benefit
1 Con
Change
not happy
don't care
couldn't care less
nothing's perfect
consistently burns
does not work very well
flawed high rating
burnt to a crisp
cheap looking
Never again
feeling a little foolish
flaw major
toss it in the trash
hurts to take it off
Concerned
crappy
not hot
can't return
tiny
Terrible
disconnected
doesn't' have that many fancy
Just like other cheap
tons of knots and wrinkles
not happy
Get a cheaper one
doesn't work
only issue
annoying thing
by no means as good
started to open and close on its own
burned taste
Leaked
countless numbers of people who have had the problem
probably would not have bought it
horribly overpriced
must be disassembled
get stuck
Pray your toaster never fails
junk
burns everything
never use
breakage issue
BUYER BEWARE
also burned
would not let our return process WITHOUT a technician certifying that the microwave has a problem
crap
Unevan Cooking
I've been a Panasonic fan for years until I purchased this microwave
doesn't work
certainly more expensive than
have no inner bin
burned badly
really hard to see
doesn't seem to cook any faster
finally gave out
Was hoping to find a good
would not buy again
Great if you like RUSTY
would make for much quieter
thicker than
stopped working
quit working
slide down
big gripe
Not as impressed as others
little small
purchased this toaster on ebay
hazardous
bad loud
pretty much started rusting immediately
Leaks badly
got bright and hot
lol
silly
not as clean
will not be purchasing another
definitely going to be shopping
learned my lesson
Even at full capacity it only makes
improperly assembled
Somewhat Disappointed
even if it runs you a few
still missing
like to spin around fast
steer clear
which is an issue
sucks
just died
two removable inner bins
broke early on
mildly irritated
weren't always consistent
Strange
half the money
can't believe this is the quality
worst
Fairly minor
wish it came
substandard
took off a star
no quality
only real drawback
constantly dumps its contents
wish I had never bought
Sorry but...didn't like it at all
leaks
doubtful the Cuisinart will make it that long
Uneven toasting
weak
fall off of it very easily
acting up
won't lift a finger to help
only drawback
extremely annoying
flooded mess
wish they made one that could detect and open in one hundredth of a second so it would open when I toss something from across the room
slight inconvenience
can't do this
prevent others from falling into the same pit I did
not had the unit available for use for a month
bit shallow
funny noise
keep the booklet handy every time I use it
DO NOT BUY THIS
not so well
don't use
well more cons then pros
coated with moist grounds
FRAUD ON THE WORLD
NOT as sensitive to touch
WAY-TOO-NOISY
cant make them better than
