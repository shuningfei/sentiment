pos		pos		can handle this 		if you can handle this it 's a good coffee maker 
pos		pos		takes an extra 		control i purchased the cuisinart because of the wattage power and the reviews however , not having an interior light is really an extremely poor product design seriously that is not why i gave it 3 stars , but does add to it i am more than rather disappointed in the fact that it does not cook consistently example i like baking sweet potatoes in the toaster oven with the thought in mind that the potatoes are the same size , sometimes it takes an extra 15 20 minutes i never ever had this problem with my delonghi

neg		neg				! 
pos		pos		seems be very 		the trash can seems be very good quality and looks great 
pos		pos		is no draining 		the only downside is there is no draining , it has to be emptied in the sink , so the clothes are sopping wet when you are through i have to leave them to drain for awhile before hanging this would be absolutely perfect for a dorm room

neg		neg		assumes the solution 		\( my rating assumes the solution above sticks \) 
neg		pos		for the toasting 		it has a beeper for the toasting and bagel function , just lets you know your toast is burnt 
pos		pos		a bit slow 		biggest drawback is that it 's a bit slow , but you learn to time that while getting other things done in the kitchen 
pos		pos		works very well 		works very well 
pos		pos		is definitely strong 		i do n't know what that reviewer was doing with his her can , but it is definitely strong enough \( i e , as strong as any other metal trash can in the price range \) and unless you are throwing rocks at it , i ca n't see how it would get dented 
pos		pos		this set would 		for the money , this set would be hard to beat

pos		pos		likes the garbage 		everyone qt our house really likes the garbage can 
neg		neg		the cups are 		unless the cups are 4 6 oz a piece 
neg		neg		been on the 		we had a cuisinart 4 slice toaster for several years that did exactly what a toaster is supposed to do untilwe discovered our cat on the kitchen counter one morning after scolding kitty and thoroughly cleaning the counter top we found evidence that a mouse had been on the counter top as well we cleaned the counter again and found evidence a mouse had been under our beloved toaster 
pos		pos		as there are 		not only the fact that i was paying 5 load , i had to stand in line to get a washer as there are only 8 washers dyers for a 20 floor building \( dumb i know \) and you dare not leave you clothing there

neg		pos				definitely bad judgement on my part 
pos		pos		was kinda annoying 		sounded like the motor was whining up , \( working hard \) so it was n't quiet i should say , quieter than a regular one but still , was kinda annoying to hear 
pos		pos		but not enough 		very powerful , but not enough gradient controls 
pos		pos		water condensation will 		everything works as advertised with a few minor exceptions when you open the lid to remove yesterdays grounds , the water condensation will pour off the lid onto your counter , also adding the water can be interesting if you use the carafe , it 's a dribbler 
pos		pos		your square footage 		it is ideal for a quick refresh though , no matter what your square footage is 
neg		pos		discovering its capabilities 		still discovering its capabilities 
pos		pos		crannies it 's 		because it 's got nooks and crannies it 's very hard to clean 
pos		pos		a smaller one 		if you are upgrading from a smaller one , be sure to check the dimensions listed in the product description before ordering it 's very well built 
pos		pos		, which means 		this is a welcome change once again from having to brush the paper filter on our hoover every time i emptied the canister the floor sweeper brush runs on a separate motor from the vacuum motor , which means you can manually switch the floor brush off while vacuuming , and the brush is only running when you pivot the handle down to do the actual vacuuming when it 's just idling upright the brushes turn off automatically 
pos		pos		a bit daunting 		they usually cost at least 3x a standard consumer model , which was a bit daunting until our most recent consumer microwave developed a hole in the rear of the cavity
