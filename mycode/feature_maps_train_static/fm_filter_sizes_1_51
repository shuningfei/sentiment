pos		pos		high magnification microscope 		the maximum thickness of the blade \( not the cutting edge \) is thicker than a traditional , quality japanese knife \( such as the sandoku \) and that alone plays a major role in the quality of cutting \( the thinner the blade , past the cutting edge , a more precise cut is attained and thus the higher the quality of the cut \) i used a high magnification microscope to examine eveness smoothness of the blade 's cutting edge and was amazed at the plethora of not only imperfections but also extensive 'chipping' which definately leaves the edge uneven and has a negative effect on the quality of cuts in the past i have examined other japanese style chef knives and could barely detect any such adverse characteristics the difference of course on those knives is their much higher pricing \( about 5 to 1 ratio \) than the pricing of the ginsu knives
