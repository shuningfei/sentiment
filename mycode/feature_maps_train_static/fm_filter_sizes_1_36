pos		pos		the lifetime warranty 		\) i have had just minor issues with balancing the knife a few times and found if i adjust how i lay it on the plate \( either put more handle on the plate or set it on vertically \( either blade up or down \) it works , but because of the design , you can easily set the knife back on the table standing with its blade down , because the business part of the blade does not touch the table to those who have rust problems not due to misuse , have you attempted to contact henckels re the lifetime warranty \? my only gripe with this product is that henckels does not make this set for 12 and 23 piece sets for 4 are available at very few places including just a small percentage of bed bath beyond stores
