pos		pos		quiet 		does n't really do the trick that well either as all it does is spin your clothes around one way , stop for about 5 sec , then spin the other direction which i noticed is what makes the bucket spin see the water is still spinning in the last direction it was going before the machine goes the other direction which makes your clothes and water stop suddenly and making the bucket lean and tilt at times and making it spin around really fast , that 's what my belt was for , but it does n't exactly save on water as u go through a lot of it rinsing out your clothes afterwards , not to mention this one was n't quiet

pos		pos				the slots are thick enough to fit a nicely sized bagel and the lever to turn on the toaster seems sturdy

pos		pos		it comes with 		you do need to buy a separate brush for the end , although it comes with a nice crevice tool \( that 's what she said \) for getting in to those crevices it 's a little yucky cleaning the dust collector , but considering the capacity you do n't want to be changing bags a lot either i have even bought this as a house warming gift !

pos		pos		coffee maker 		if you can handle this it 's a good coffee maker 
pos		pos		why i gave 		control i purchased the cuisinart because of the wattage power and the reviews however , not having an interior light is really an extremely poor product design seriously that is not why i gave it 3 stars , but does add to it i am more than rather disappointed in the fact that it does not cook consistently example i like baking sweet potatoes in the toaster oven with the thought in mind that the potatoes are the same size , sometimes it takes an extra 15 20 minutes i never ever had this problem with my delonghi

pos		pos		downside is there 		the only downside is there is no draining , it has to be emptied in the sink , so the clothes are sopping wet when you are through i have to leave them to drain for awhile before hanging this would be absolutely perfect for a dorm room 
neg		neg		stock 		local dealers only had smaller , stainless models in stock

neg		pos		burnt 		it has a beeper for the toasting and bagel function , just lets you know your toast is burnt 
pos		pos				biggest drawback is that it 's a bit slow , but you learn to time that while getting other things done in the kitchen 
pos		pos				works very well 
pos		pos		\) and unless 		i do n't know what that reviewer was doing with his her can , but it is definitely strong enough \( i e , as strong as any other metal trash can in the price range \) and unless you are throwing rocks at it , i ca n't see how it would get dented

pos		pos		hear 		sounded like the motor was whining up , \( working hard \) so it was n't quiet i should say , quieter than a regular one but still , was kinda annoying to hear 
pos		pos		controls 		very powerful , but not enough gradient controls 
pos		pos		dribbler 		everything works as advertised with a few minor exceptions when you open the lid to remove yesterdays grounds , the water condensation will pour off the lid onto your counter , also adding the water can be interesting if you use the carafe , it 's a dribbler

pos		pos		motor , which 		this is a welcome change once again from having to brush the paper filter on our hoover every time i emptied the canister the floor sweeper brush runs on a separate motor from the vacuum motor , which means you can manually switch the floor brush off while vacuuming , and the brush is only running when you pivot the handle down to do the actual vacuuming when it 's just idling upright the brushes turn off automatically 
pos		pos		recent consumer microwave 		they usually cost at least 3x a standard consumer model , which was a bit daunting until our most recent consumer microwave developed a hole in the rear of the cavity 
pos		pos		\) , bamboo 		read many reviews before buying this product \( including consumer reports flawed high rating \) and now , after using it , i am quite amazed of the overly positive writings this has received positives knives are well balanced , not very heavy , blades are sharp \( although they need to be honed every time after being used to keep them sharp \) , bamboo quality finish look is great , and product carries mfr 's limited life warranty ! negatives there is a lot to say upon first visual contact one can easily tell this is not a japanese made product \( i erroneously assumed so !

pos		pos		amazing 		exchanged it and the second one works amazing 
pos		pos		warped 		my wife takes it to the service repair jerk who tells her there 's nothing wrong with the microwave and messes up the reconstruction of the unit so now the frame is all warped 
pos		pos				if i had a hidden can i would n't spend this much money , but with our can being out i wanted to have a nice looking can that was easy to use 
pos		pos		coffee 		i 'll start by saying the keurig b60 makes a phenomenal cup of coffee 
pos		pos		one ! 		the free small trash can works even better than the large one ! 
pos		pos		quieter operation 		i was hoping that microwave technology in this day and age would make for much quieter operation

neg		neg		a handheld shower 		i really , really wanted to use this machine and see how it worked i have a handheld shower nozzle in the tub so i used a small piece of rope to secure the washer drain hose to the hose in the shower 
neg		pos		money 		new deal they will give me the new purchase price from their toy money 
pos		pos		a mean and 		it 's a mean and hurtful machine , designed to make you cry into your poorly toasted toast at the 350 you parted with

pos		pos		! 		where i was spending 50 a month just at the laundry mat , i wo n't miss doing that anymore trust me ! 
pos		pos				i paid 170 for this big , expensive microwave 
pos		pos		blades 		this isnt even good as a starter set , as you 're never going to use them without kevlar gloves , unless you like splinters and cutting yourself from using more force to slice from the dull unsharpable blades 
pos		pos		brewing 		not only that , but it keeps it hot enough for my wife \( who prefers her beverages as near the boiling point as possible \) for hours after brewing

pos		pos		do 		to add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent we 're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back that 's what we tried to do

pos		pos		it 		it seems like a little ghost kid is messing with it 
pos		pos		a reduction in 		it is still a good unit but is a step down from the older model , which is not the direction of change that i expected , and indicates a reduction in general design and production quality for the brand 
neg		neg		bags 		it uses plastic grocery bags and has hooks at the front and back of the inner container that you use to attach the bags 
pos		pos		future 		counter top microwave this is my 3rd round maybe because the previous ones were manufactured in the united states , the quality was to my satisfaction however , this one , maybe because it 's manufactured in china annoyingly way too noisy , buttons are not as sensitive to touch , especially the start button \( have to hold down the unit with one hand press hard the sb 2 3 times with the other inconvenient \) signs are not clearly visible another inconvenience as it 's compact serves my need ! as for the power usage , we shall see when i get the bill i 'll get adjusted to the inconveniences but the high volume noise of this product is something else hope , it gets improved in the future

pos		pos		basket 		i find i can use less sugar or cream since the coffee tastes so much better from this ! i'm using my 4 cone filters up with it by tearing a small hole to put through the tube and just folding it down to fit in the basket 
pos		pos				comparing to the previous reviews , the forks are actually real sturdy 
pos		pos		a simple wire 		the shark 's canister only has a simple wire mesh filter on the central exhaust tube so there 's nothing to clean when you empty the canister , making the whole process much less messy and more pleasant for me the thick foam filter that leads to the motor is designed to be removed and washed every few months

pos		pos		applicance 		i would definitely recommend this applicance 
pos		pos				powerful for its size 
pos		pos		levers will not 		it has one problem so far very often when i press the levers to start the toasting process the levers will not stay down and i have to repeat the process several times before the bread will stay down 
pos		pos		11 		there is also a 1 6 dial for setting your toasting level , too bad it does n't go to 11

pos		pos		died 		after juryrigging the battery compartment with tape it worked for one more day then gave up the ghost and died 
pos		pos		! 		better than expected !

pos		pos		compartments ensures no 		the fact that the water reservoir and the coffee grounds filter are separate compartments ensures no cross contamination which is one reason i picked this unit in the first place 
neg		pos		handle 		i'm a college student who just moved to a small apt without a microwave so i needed something small but hardy enough to handle whatever i needed it to handle 
pos		pos				we have used this oven almost daily for nearly 6 years now and it has never let us down 
pos		pos		a 'no touch' 		highly recommend it to anyone seeking a 'no touch' trash can 
pos		pos		vacuum , super 		great little vacuum , super long 20ft cable that can be wrapped easily , very simple features that do n't require crazy thinking , comes assembled , has huge suction power , easy cleaning of filter , modern looking color , and overall awesome only small con is the hose is quite short but nothing that ca n't be improvised 
pos		pos		buck ! 		best bang for the buck ! 
pos		pos				this is my 2nd , the former lasted more than 5 years before batteries gave out and handle broke 
pos		pos		much ! 		never knew i could like a trashcan this much ! 
pos		pos				other than that , it 's a good product overall 
pos		pos		look 		the design of the toaster is very nice and will compliment many of todays kitchen appliances with the black and stainless steel look

pos		pos		a favor and 		do yourself a favor and do not buy this ! 
pos		pos		that the lid 		i agree with everyone else that the lid is a joke , i use it is to prevent water from flying out of the bucket while its running and then to use it as a tray for my clothes to still rinse i have had this little washer for years and it 's still running strong ! 
pos		pos		nope 		nope

pos		pos		\) 		after less than 30 minutes of cutting you will be able to tell that the knife has become dull conclusion in search of great japanese style knives \( and there are many but way more expensive \) if you choose the ginsu chikara \( chinese made \) knives you just get exactly what you pay for \( inferior product for less \) 
pos		pos		value 		excellent value 
pos		pos		coffee 		good cup of coffee 
pos		pos		vacuum cleaner 		you cannot lift the longer tube off unless you have completely unstowed the power cord , as the power cord essentially lashes the tube extension to the canister base while it is stowed other than these complaints i'm quite impressed with this vacuum cleaner 
pos		pos		laundromat 		i find this little spin dryer very handy , for hand washing and saving trips to the laundromat 
pos		pos		vacuum , great 		great vacuum , great price 
neg		neg		years 		i use every day and have had it about 4 years 
pos		pos		most 		hope it is a long lived unit as it is certainly more expensive than most 
pos		pos		the loudest either 		we now have a post it note stuck over the display at night it 's not quiet not the loudest either 
pos		pos		a carafe 		i just wish it came with a carafe 
pos		pos				replace it as soon as you can make a trip to the pet store 
pos		pos		a new appliance 		i did n't really care if it did rugs very well , but it does a better job than my oreck xl ! it is light , and has a very flexible head so gets in all the tight spaces better than my swiffer ! there is a bit of a new appliance odor when you first start to use it , but it dissipates quickly thank you , everyone , for all the reviews you posted , which convinced me to buy this great item 
neg		pos		again 		as soon as i plug it back in it starts up again 
pos		pos		flatware , these 		i looked high and low for quality disposable flatware , these did the trick

pos		pos				cool garbage can 
pos		pos		too 		a friend was having the save problem , so i bought him one and it solved his problem too 
pos		pos		a blessing 		my husband has his eggs and toast every morning and this product was a blessing 
pos		pos		shows no signs 		and , btw , re other reviewers' comments you can force the toast up if you want to , it just takes a little effort , and after five years of doing it , the handle shows no signs of breaking from the pressure today 's manufacturing being what it is , i suppose you can always get a bad one , but if you get one that works , this is a fine little toaster 
pos		pos		so unfair buyer 		and if your replacement machine happens to also fail like mine did , you 're out of luck as the warranty is only for the duration of your original purchase , in other words the replacement machine is not warranted , which i think is so unfair buyer beware 
pos		pos		and powerful microwave 		great and powerful microwave 
pos		pos		bought this oven 		i bought this oven a year back and it ran perfectly well 
pos		pos		hand 		they fit your hand better than skinny handles , so you can use them without hurting your hand 
neg		neg		bowls 		you can heat cups , small sized bowls 
pos		pos		look elsewhere 		so if you 're a college student or someone living in a small apartment and you 're looking for something small that can keep your floors clean , look elsewhere 
pos		pos		scenario 		i 'd like to return it , but the dents i put in the side from kicking the thing when it refused to cooperate kind of makes that an unlikely scenario 
neg		pos		timer , resulting 		each time you have to guess at where to stop the timer , resulting in either an not toasted enough result , or a too toasted result 
pos		pos		cup 		the water ran too quickly through the grounds and the coffee was weak no matter how firm the grounds were packed into the cup 
pos		pos		do n't 		after having it for a month and a half the three buttons that determine the amount of coffee that is to be dispensed do not work properly sometimes they provide the right amount , and sometimes they do n't 
pos		pos		\) , it 		however , through trial and error i have figured out that if i put enough clothes into each load \( but not too much , otherwise the machine stops working \) , it prevents this whirlpool effect 
neg		neg		applicance connection 		we bought our unit online at applicance connection 
pos		pos		! 		this seemed to be it !

pos		pos		little apppliance 		works great all in all a handy little apppliance 
pos		pos		the lid 		now i know people have complained about the motion sensor stopped working , but had for a few months and on a couple of occasions it did stop working , but due to the trash was up to the lid and hit the turn off button on the underside of the lid 
pos		pos		buy 		does n't work do n't buy 
neg		neg		11 years , 		we had a panasonic microwave that gave out after 11 years , and we had one before that 
pos		pos		have reported 		the trash bag is kept hidden by the inner ring and i 've had no problems with mine as others have reported 
pos		pos		near furniture and 		you do n't have to worry about vacuuming up toys with the floor unit while you 're trying to vacuum cobwebs off the walls or ceiling with the hose i initially thought the swivel base was a useless gimmick but i 've decided it 's quite helpful when you 're vacuuming along a wall or near furniture and the handle canister would otherwise be running into the wall the hose brush attachment has a swiveling beveled joint with its intake tube , which means you can change the angle of the brush with respect to the hose 
pos		pos		done 		in just 3 loads i had all my laundry done 
pos		pos				the lid is wide and deep enough when it opens 
pos		pos		features 		i like the size of this micro , does n't take up as much room as my last one , but has same wattage and better features 
neg		neg		when your bag 		i hate having to touch lids to open them and the way lids get in the way when your bag is starting to get full 
pos		pos		popcorn button once 		the first level is for the standard size so you just hit the popcorn button once and then start and it comes out great 
pos		pos		analog power display 		first thing i did was tap the power button then turn the wheel , but no , that would be too easy and intuitive with the pseudo analog power display to watch as you do it , unlike controlling time this would actually work nicely 
pos		pos		far 		very nice so far 
pos		pos		latch 		i like the fact that the lid has a latch 
pos		pos		plenty of room 		plenty of room , easy to use 
neg		pos		more 		just press the button that says a bit more 
pos		pos		it 		otherwise , i would high recommend it 
pos		pos		sharp 		these knives are well worth the money watch out though very sharp 
neg		pos		\) 		\( i still do n't like carrying it outside , though \) 
pos		pos		it 		love it 
pos		pos		charmer 		then i bought this little charmer 
pos		pos		\) and the 		also , i have been hand washing the knives , but one of them is starting to rust already , by the handle , \( 2 weeks old \) and the scissors have discolored along with another knife 
pos		pos				underpowered 
pos		pos		\? 		i was dubious about the 'automatic' motor drive system to lower and lift the toast , but it works fine , and , best of all \? 
pos		pos				we particularly liked the red as it adds the right dash of color to a kitchen already full of stainless and black 
neg		pos		very heavy 		the ratio of floor area to molding is very low , so i found myself spending a lot of time and effort trying to keep the molding clean , especially because the dyson wand is very heavy 
pos		pos		\) and i 		i use 13 gallon trash bags \( regular drawstring kind , not simplehuman trash bags \) and i think they fit really well 
pos		pos		breville ! 		goodbye dualit , hello breville !

pos		pos		bin ever 		the best trash bin ever 
pos		pos		trash ! 		perfect for keeping my toddler out of the trash ! 
pos		pos		not careful 		the negatives 1 \) the automatic slide out rack can become disconnected and almost fall out if you 're not careful 
pos		pos		\) , they 		\) , they are still reviewing our case ! 
pos		pos		hot 		it 's only real flaw is the water only gets adequately hot , rather than piping hot 
pos		pos		and i'm very 		i 've had this washer for about six weeks and i'm very happy with it 
pos		pos		nobody does it 		nobody does it like you ! 
pos		pos		those membrane switch 		the discrete buttons provide good tactile feedback and are much nicer that those membrane switch panels most microwaves use 
pos		pos		bread 		heats and toasts fast but has no timer dials hard to read burns bread 
pos		pos		star 		so just sayin if you cook with it , keep an eye on it so you do n't burn your house down ps the toaster is totaled changing rating to 1 star 
pos		pos				since the cats do n't smell the food they do n't get into the can 
pos		pos		needs 		perfect for my needs 
pos		pos		do 		state of the art it is not ! it makes a good cup of coffee , but most drip makers do 
neg		pos		much 		the lid on the thermos is hard to twist if you tighten it too much 
pos		pos		weeks 		the motor broke in less than two weeks 
pos		pos		\) 		our favorite details are the melt soften feature \( works very well ! \) 
pos		pos		a slight downgrade 		this was a slight downgrade from my last panasonic microwave , but i needed a slightly smaller one , and could n't pay quite as much 
neg		pos		a spinner 		ringing out is n't the most fun thing to do but if your not washing a lot i would n't see a need for a spinner 
pos		pos				junk 
pos		pos		mornings 		the toast gradations do really work for really light to a dark brown for cold dark mornings 
pos		pos		this washer 		so needless to say this was very annoying and time consuming ! after living here for 7 months my husband and i finally gave up and bought this washer 
pos		pos		a reasonable price 		great product at a reasonable price 
neg		pos		! 		sparkles like new ! 
pos		pos		steel 		not stainless steel 
pos		pos		time 		it is by far the best purchase i have made in a long time 
pos		pos		much 		the sleek stainless steel design is also nice the only drawbacks are a lack of a number pad , which makes entering time a little bit more of a hassle , and that the reheat mode seems to heat things too much 
pos		pos		utterly useless 		i'm truly surprised someone would manufacture something so utterly useless 
pos		pos		controls and clock 		can be confusing options for setting the controls and clock 
pos		pos		hobbs appliances , 		as with some of the other russell hobbs appliances , i feel that they are slightly overpriced 
pos		pos				great coffee easy to use 
pos		pos		product 		really great product 
neg		pos		so 		i 've had friends say that they 're fancier , more expensive diaper pails also get stinky after a year or so 
pos		pos		lint 		this ca n't even pick up pieces of lint 
pos		pos		man i'm glad 		man i'm glad i did , this vac is the best ! !

pos		pos		thing wrong with 		works exactly how it should my egg and bagel or muffin are always done and perfect everytime i slap some cheese and a slice of ham and in 5 min i'm breakfast bound i honestly ca n't find a thing wrong with this awesome toaster 
neg		neg		car 		i also live in an apartment and did n't like dragging my baskets of clothes and washing items down the steps to my car 
pos		pos		coffee 		very easy to learn to use and the coffee tastes much better than my old drip coffee 
pos		pos		as advertised 		toasting is a little uneven but acceptable and the outer surface stays cool , just as advertised 
pos		pos				easy to use , very solid and know we will have years of use 
neg		neg		vac 		hoover stem vac 
pos		pos		a negative effect 		the maximum thickness of the blade \( not the cutting edge \) is thicker than a traditional , quality japanese knife \( such as the sandoku \) and that alone plays a major role in the quality of cutting \( the thinner the blade , past the cutting edge , a more precise cut is attained and thus the higher the quality of the cut \) i used a high magnification microscope to examine eveness smoothness of the blade 's cutting edge and was amazed at the plethora of not only imperfections but also extensive 'chipping' which definately leaves the edge uneven and has a negative effect on the quality of cuts in the past i have examined other japanese style chef knives and could barely detect any such adverse characteristics the difference of course on those knives is their much higher pricing \( about 5 to 1 ratio \) than the pricing of the ginsu knives 
pos		pos		! 		perfect ! 
pos		pos		almost no mounting 		no top closure and almost no mounting options mean this thing constantly dumps its contents 
neg		neg		sandwiches 		i 've made 7 egg sandwiches 
neg		neg		oven 		toaster oven 
pos		pos		and controls 		i especially like the buttons and controls 
pos		pos		alarm 		i definitely appreciate the coffee 's done alarm 
pos		pos		a gripe overall 		i suppose that 's barely a gripe overall , i when using it i'm just mildly irritated by the awkwardness of it , and regret the purchase 
pos		pos		it higher 		if it had lasted longer i would have rated it higher 
pos		pos		vacuum 		very disappointed about this vacuum 
neg		pos		pair of white 		he gave me a pair of white shorts that looked like he did a do or die mission in them 
neg		pos		counts 		that 's all that counts 
neg		pos		me 		if i need longer cook time just restart for another few minutes , may be why it has not died on me 
neg		pos		\) 		also u would think since u have like a gallon and a half of water sitting on top of a motor that 's using 120 volts at about 3 amps and god knows how many watts , it would at least have a 3 prong plug at the end so it had something to ground out too , \( if the house apt is equipped with it \) 
pos		pos		cycle is completed 		it has electronic controls , and gives a nice beep signal when the cycle is completed
