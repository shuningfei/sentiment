pos		pos		smell so fresh 		they smell so fresh 
pos		pos		technology is great 		the new technology is great , i use sensor reheat quite frequently , it heats my dishes up nicely without getting so hot it burns you 
pos		pos		this is a 		this is a very large stainless steel microwave

pos		pos		great quality how 		i simply can not believe how great this set is for so little money \? super sharp , well balanced , attractive , seemingly great quality how do they do it \?

neg		pos		my 20 mocha 		my 20 mocha makes a better cup of espresso , no question there 
neg		pos		it generally works 		i decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews it generally works as described the main annoying thing \( which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan \) is it appears to have a 15 20 second after use pause so if you put something in , and immediately want to throw something else away , you either have to wait what seems like forever , or open it by hand my previous sensor can would immediately open again if i went to it again within 1 3 seconds 
neg		pos		defrost should be 		defrost should be call cook instead of defrost 
pos		pos		cute oven 		this is a cute oven 
neg		neg		and now manually 		or worse , when we had several small handfuls to deposit into the bin , it would close right before we tossed the next load in , necessitating a time consuming cleanup eventually we turned off the bloody infrared sensor , and now manually raise and close the lid

pos		pos		recommend this maker 		all in all , i would not recommend this maker unless you get it for some wonderful deal eta that one month later we 've broken the carafe 
pos		neg		ease of cleaning 		i sure like the ease of cleaning a floor without having to bend over and hurt my back i have an extra battery , so when one battery runs down , i just put it in the charger , put the already charged battery in and off i go again ! i just ca n't say enough good things about this vacuum cleaner everybody should have one 
neg		pos		open the trash 		last week the hinge to open the trash can finally gave out and broke 
neg		neg		suction of an 		although i was n't expecting the suction of an expensive vacuum , i was expecting just a little more suction

neg		pos		and buy a 		no doubt looking for bread crumbs concerned with the prospect of disease and no way to clean the toaster , we had no choice but to discard our toaster and buy a new one we purchased a replacement four slice cuisinart and it arrived in a few days it was obvious it was not the same quality as our first cuisinart and the lift levers really feel cheap they feel like they might break at any moment 
pos		pos		flavorful coffee that 		using a burr grinder on the course setting seems to make the most flavorful coffee that is never bitter 
pos		pos		easy to take 		the crumb tray is easy to take out and clean 
neg		neg		hot that i 		although the bread toasts evenly , the metal area surrounding the slots becomes so hot that i had a blister on my finger from a burn i sustained while just touching the area !

pos		pos		love this toaster 		absolutely love this toaster 
neg		neg		easy to use 		overall the machine is light , easy to use , and out of the way when stored on its wall mount just do n't expect a miniature vacuum the brush on the front is innovative , but it is by no means a replacement for a rotary brush 
neg		pos		worth to spend 		i think it 's worth to spend an extra 20 and have a solid coffee maker 
pos		pos		every aspect of 		every aspect of this purchase was accomplished in a timely and efficient manner 
pos		pos		love it ! 		love it !

pos		pos		container is a 		dirt container is a little small , but i do n't mind emptying more often cause the thing works great 
pos		pos		recommend it or 		13 gal bags work well in the cans but when the can is full the bag is full also , there is not alot of extra space to tie the bag so if you could find a little bigger bag i would recommend it or use the 13 gal with the build in handles its so nice when you have something messy or sticky you just move your hand in front of it and it opens you drop your trash no muss no fuss 
pos		pos		this price range 		it also removes a surprisingly large amount of grit , which is hard to find in this price range 
pos		pos		readout is a 		it is a good looking appearance and cabinet , and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well our unit does have a rather loud beep volume , and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other panasonic microwave models

neg		neg		and buy a 		to add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent we 're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back that 's what we tried to do 
pos		pos		great buy 		for the money this is a great buy 
neg		pos		great if you 		great if you like rusty knives 
neg		neg		sensor is not 		after a couple of month or so , the sensor is not working at all 
pos		neg		high power machine 		it 's not exactly difficult , but it certainly is n't as easy as tapping a digit or 3 to set a time directly it 's a high power machine so dialing it back makes sense quite often and that 's why it has the inverter feature 
neg		pos		it is fairly 		it is fairly big
