neg		pos		tend to throw 		so , another problem with me is that i tend to throw away packaging whenever i purchase something , so there was n't really an easy way to return this toaster 
neg		pos		was still surprised 		even though this is an inexpensive stick vacuum i was still surprised by the lack of suction power , especially for a plug in model 
pos		neg		d \) the 		at the end , lightly tamp before pulling the shot d \) the espresso is plenty dark 
pos		pos		great gift for 		great gift for a kid

neg		pos		plates for microwaving 		i used one of those plates for microwaving bacon and it just barely fit 
neg		neg		1 month and 		had maker for approx 1 month and auto shut down started acting up 
neg		neg		quite difficult to 		however , in the case of this microwave , it is really quite difficult to shut the door without touching the stainless would have been more convenient for a small touch pad on the door to avoid having to constantly wipe off the smudges

pos		pos		great little trash 		great little trash can ! 
pos		pos		has tremendous suction 		it does what it 's built to do it 's much lighter in weight than my old eureka boss that died last year and it has tremendous suction power

pos		pos		continue to recommend 		if it breaks i would likely purchase another and will continue to recommend this model to friends 
neg		pos		want toasted \( 		also , the the wire grill that you lay the item you want toasted \( or baked \) on , has a hook on it , which enables it to slide out as you open the door , but many times does not close very smoothly , you have to jimmie it a bit to close

pos		pos		trying to find 		this is an update two years later \( 01 13 \) still working as described below keeps going and going i'm writing this review out of frustration re trying to find a new toaster , and we 're now going to keep this one , and you may want to give it a try , too 
pos		pos		so fresh 		they smell so fresh 
pos		pos		is great , 		the new technology is great , i use sensor reheat quite frequently , it heats my dishes up nicely without getting so hot it burns you 
pos		pos		very large stainless 		this is a very large stainless steel microwave 
neg		pos		it quit brewing 		it quit brewing ful pots and would turn off as soon as it was done brewing 
pos		pos		makes perfect toast 		and it makes perfect toast , each and every time my family lives on bread 
pos		pos		very reasonably priced 		this is a good microwave and very reasonably priced 
pos		pos		two batteries a 		two batteries a plus ! 
neg		neg		nice , but 		a plug for the outlet hose would be nice , but a wad of paper blocks it ok

pos		pos		perfect perfect coffee 		this makes perfect perfect coffee every time 
pos		pos		handle larger dishes 		larger than most models , but can handle larger dishes , turntable helps cook food more evenly 
neg		neg		dribbler 		everything works as advertised with a few minor exceptions when you open the lid to remove yesterdays grounds , the water condensation will pour off the lid onto your counter , also adding the water can be interesting if you use the carafe , it 's a dribbler 
pos		pos		love the program 		for the most part , i love it the good i love the program feature coffee is all made when i wake up 
pos		pos		how great this 		i simply can not believe how great this set is for so little money \? super sharp , well balanced , attractive , seemingly great quality how do they do it \? 
pos		pos		an excellent supplemental 		i would say that , for what i payed for it , the wonderwash \( er \) is an excellent supplemental tool i have mine on my kitchen counter and it is very useful as i am a single man who only sporadically can make it to the laundromat 
pos		pos		works fine 		the controls are great , it 's really good looking , and it works fine 
pos		neg		buying a cheaper 		i purchased this toaster after buying a cheaper one at wal mart that did not work 
pos		pos		works well 		its a nice micrwave for the price , easy to use and works well 
neg		neg		anything even slightly 		but for anything even slightly out of the ordinary , it just plain does n't work

pos		pos		's durable , 		if it 's durable , we 'll have this one for a long time 
neg		pos		my 20 mocha 		my 20 mocha makes a better cup of espresso , no question there 
neg		pos		want to throw 		i decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews it generally works as described the main annoying thing \( which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan \) is it appears to have a 15 20 second after use pause so if you put something in , and immediately want to throw something else away , you either have to wait what seems like forever , or open it by hand my previous sensor can would immediately open again if i went to it again within 1 3 seconds 
neg		pos		be call cook 		defrost should be call cook instead of defrost 
pos		pos		cute oven 		this is a cute oven 
neg		neg		it would close 		or worse , when we had several small handfuls to deposit into the bin , it would close right before we tossed the next load in , necessitating a time consuming cleanup eventually we turned off the bloody infrared sensor , and now manually raise and close the lid 
pos		pos		works great for 		and it works great for those applications the little flip out brush and pull out extended reach tube are very well thought out 
pos		pos		's easy to 		it 's easy to put the bags in and out 
pos		neg		wind 		the lid also locks so it is not flapping around in the wind 
pos		pos		's compact but 		it 's compact but does what the big boys does on a smaller scale 
pos		pos		wonderful deal eta 		all in all , i would not recommend this maker unless you get it for some wonderful deal eta that one month later we 've broken the carafe 
pos		neg		having to bend 		i sure like the ease of cleaning a floor without having to bend over and hurt my back i have an extra battery , so when one battery runs down , i just put it in the charger , put the already charged battery in and off i go again ! i just ca n't say enough good things about this vacuum cleaner everybody should have one 
neg		pos		out and broke 		last week the hinge to open the trash can finally gave out and broke 
neg		neg		more suction 		although i was n't expecting the suction of an expensive vacuum , i was expecting just a little more suction 
neg		pos		everything put into 		and , we found it in the perfect shade of red that matched our other counter top appliances unfortunately , it burns everything put into the oven 
pos		neg		nice hot coffee 		nice hot coffee but the next time i went to make a pot the water would n't come out 
pos		pos		wonderful toaster ! 		wonderful toaster ! 
pos		neg		trying to bend 		it is pretty solid plastic , so unless you are trying to bend it when pulling the trash bags out , i ca n't see how it would crack and break 
pos		pos		, it was 		at about 250 , it was a real bargain 
pos		pos		very well 		i have nothing to compare it to , so i will just tell you our experience with it first of all , it bakes very well 
pos		pos		works great 		we have had it in the house for two months now and everything works great 
neg		pos		'll hear and 		you 'll hear and see the drops and you will have to clean them c \) it brews too fast and then the coffee keeps being heated , until it starts having a burned taste

pos		neg		heck out of 		sure beats the heck out of our old white wal mart microwave 
neg		neg		just right \( 		if you do n't put the basket in just right \( no room for error \) you will have a flooded mess of coffee grounds 
neg		pos		it arrived in 		no doubt looking for bread crumbs concerned with the prospect of disease and no way to clean the toaster , we had no choice but to discard our toaster and buy a new one we purchased a replacement four slice cuisinart and it arrived in a few days it was obvious it was not the same quality as our first cuisinart and the lift levers really feel cheap they feel like they might break at any moment 
pos		pos		seems to make 		using a burr grinder on the course setting seems to make the most flavorful coffee that is never bitter 
pos		pos		easy to take 		the crumb tray is easy to take out and clean 
neg		neg		that i had 		although the bread toasts evenly , the metal area surrounding the slots becomes so hot that i had a blister on my finger from a burn i sustained while just touching the area ! 
pos		pos		, versatile microwave 		good , versatile microwave 
neg		neg		pedal to get 		i wanted a hands free trash container that would close after i threw something away , but i have to either close it manually , or wedge my toe under the pedal to get the lid the close

pos		pos		especially like the 		i especially like the buttons and controls 
neg		neg		putting a towel 		the first one leaked after only a couple of uses so i returned that one update 3 24 13 note that these all leak i had to return another one and am now on my third i just found a puddle of water on the floor so i will try putting a towel under or around the washer 
pos		pos		love this toaster 		absolutely love this toaster 
neg		neg		easy to use 		overall the machine is light , easy to use , and out of the way when stored on its wall mount just do n't expect a miniature vacuum the brush on the front is innovative , but it is by no means a replacement for a rotary brush 
neg		pos		worth to spend 		i think it 's worth to spend an extra 20 and have a solid coffee maker 
pos		pos		was accomplished in 		every aspect of this purchase was accomplished in a timely and efficient manner 
pos		pos		love it ! 		love it ! 
pos		pos		very good looking 		very good looking but performs terribly

pos		pos		love this coffee 		we love this coffee pot for the different choices it gives you 
pos		pos		very well 		the hoover stick works very well 
pos		pos		costs vs a 		when you consider the ingredient costs vs a mc breakfast , it really does n't have to last that long to be worthwhile , not to mention the convenience and health benefits 
pos		pos		such as expobar 		the coffee from the delonghi is just as good as from jura and even some manual models such as expobar and rancillo 
pos		pos		3 \) cooks 		this microwave is 1 \) the perfect size , 2 \) comes with excellent directions for using the technology , and 3 \) cooks beautifully !

pos		pos		very fast and 		i got the vacuum very fast and about broke my neck to open it 
pos		pos		awesome in the 		while this garbage can is awesome in the beginning , it just does n't stand the test of time 
pos		pos		works great 		dirt container is a little small , but i do n't mind emptying more often cause the thing works great 
pos		pos		so nice when 		13 gal bags work well in the cans but when the can is full the bag is full also , there is not alot of extra space to tie the bag so if you could find a little bigger bag i would recommend it or use the 13 gal with the build in handles its so nice when you have something messy or sticky you just move your hand in front of it and it opens you drop your trash no muss no fuss 
pos		pos		hard to find 		it also removes a surprisingly large amount of grit , which is hard to find in this price range 
pos		pos		nice to be 		it is a good looking appearance and cabinet , and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well our unit does have a rather loud beep volume , and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other panasonic microwave models 
neg		pos		going strong let 		another set i have had for 5 years came from ikea and they are still going strong let 's see how long these last 
pos		pos		very attractive 		black with white lettering is very attractive

neg		neg		finger to help 		we are good customers and did everything we were told to do and we 're left with a damaged product which was broken out of the box and panasonic wo n't lift a finger to help avoid at all costs 
neg		neg		're inclined to 		to add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent we 're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back that 's what we tried to do 
pos		pos		great buy 		for the money this is a great buy 
neg		pos		great if you 		great if you like rusty knives 
neg		neg		not working at 		after a couple of month or so , the sensor is not working at all 
pos		neg		easy as tapping 		it 's not exactly difficult , but it certainly is n't as easy as tapping a digit or 3 to set a time directly it 's a high power machine so dialing it back makes sense quite often and that 's why it has the inverter feature 
neg		pos		fairly big 		it is fairly big 
neg		neg		not fit 		the only drawback was that the retainer ring that was sent did not fit 
pos		pos		worked great 		i use this washer with my kitchen faucet and it has worked great

pos		pos		great price 		great product , great price

pos		neg		was suprised at 		i was debating about returning it and ordering a can without a lid , but we decided that we really this can i honestly was suprised at how perfect this can looked , and is constructed now it just needs a few knicks or scratches so it will match the rest of the house ! update i noticed a few reviewers are worried that the can may be break because of a plastic piece , even though i did n't see anybody actually say that it did break 
neg		pos		profit \) information 		consumer reports magazine should be ashamed of yourselves in 'manufacturing' and presenting cooked up \( i am sure for profit \) information to your subscribers !

pos		pos		very easy to 		it 's very easy to assemble and operate 
pos		pos		good job of 		our old ge unit would do a good job of heating the edges of the food items and leave a cold core , but not the case with this unit 
pos		pos		like the carafe 		i especially like the carafe warming plate 
pos		pos		seems to be 		i'm not sure what temperature this brews at , but it seems to be hotter than other machines i 've tried in the price range in all , this is a good coffee maker for the price 
neg		neg		it is a 		the only negative to the unit is that it is a fingerprint magnet , as are most stainless steel appliances 
pos		neg		easy to hit 		worse comes to worse you can take out the 6 d batteries that should last for years if the kiddies figure out the on off button but that 's unlikely it has a stay open button as well , for those busy occassions and , they both stay as clean as you choose to keep them because it 's so easy to hit the mark every time !
