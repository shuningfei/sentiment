neg		neg		touching the stainless 		however , in the case of this microwave , it is really quite difficult to shut the door without touching the stainless would have been more convenient for a small touch pad on the door to avoid having to constantly wipe off the smudges

pos		pos		will continue to 		if it breaks i would likely purchase another and will continue to recommend this model to friends 
neg		pos		open the door 		also , the the wire grill that you lay the item you want toasted \( or baked \) on , has a hook on it , which enables it to slide out as you open the door , but many times does not close very smoothly , you have to jimmie it a bit to close

pos		pos		they smell so 		they smell so fresh 
pos		pos		hot it burns 		the new technology is great , i use sensor reheat quite frequently , it heats my dishes up nicely without getting so hot it burns you 
pos		pos		very large stainless 		this is a very large stainless steel microwave 
neg		pos		would turn off 		it quit brewing ful pots and would turn off as soon as it was done brewing 
pos		pos		perfect toast , 		and it makes perfect toast , each and every time my family lives on bread 
pos		pos		very reasonably priced 		this is a good microwave and very reasonably priced 
pos		pos		two batteries a 		two batteries a plus ! 
neg		neg		be nice , 		a plug for the outlet hose would be nice , but a wad of paper blocks it ok

pos		pos		this makes perfect 		this makes perfect perfect coffee every time 
pos		pos		most models , 		larger than most models , but can handle larger dishes , turntable helps cook food more evenly 
neg		neg		will pour off 		everything works as advertised with a few minor exceptions when you open the lid to remove yesterdays grounds , the water condensation will pour off the lid onto your counter , also adding the water can be interesting if you use the carafe , it 's a dribbler 
pos		pos		is all made 		for the most part , i love it the good i love the program feature coffee is all made when i wake up 
pos		pos		, attractive , 		i simply can not believe how great this set is for so little money \? super sharp , well balanced , attractive , seemingly great quality how do they do it \? 
pos		pos		i am a 		i would say that , for what i payed for it , the wonderwash \( er \) is an excellent supplemental tool i have mine on my kitchen counter and it is very useful as i am a single man who only sporadically can make it to the laundromat 
pos		pos		good looking , 		the controls are great , it 's really good looking , and it works fine 
pos		neg		one at wal 		i purchased this toaster after buying a cheaper one at wal mart that did not work 
pos		pos		the price , 		its a nice micrwave for the price , easy to use and works well 
neg		neg		does n't work 		but for anything even slightly out of the ordinary , it just plain does n't work 
pos		pos		can cook more 		we can cook more than one item at a time due to its large capacity , which is a real time saver ! 
pos		pos		have this one 		if it 's durable , we 'll have this one for a long time 
neg		pos		my 20 mocha 		my 20 mocha makes a better cup of espresso , no question there 
neg		pos		the main annoying 		i decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews it generally works as described the main annoying thing \( which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan \) is it appears to have a 15 20 second after use pause so if you put something in , and immediately want to throw something else away , you either have to wait what seems like forever , or open it by hand my previous sensor can would immediately open again if i went to it again within 1 3 seconds 
neg		pos		of defrost 		defrost should be call cook instead of defrost 
pos		pos		is a cute 		this is a cute oven 
neg		neg		into the bin 		or worse , when we had several small handfuls to deposit into the bin , it would close right before we tossed the next load in , necessitating a time consuming cleanup eventually we turned off the bloody infrared sensor , and now manually raise and close the lid 
pos		pos		brush and pull 		and it works great for those applications the little flip out brush and pull out extended reach tube are very well thought out 
pos		pos		in and out 		it 's easy to put the bags in and out 
pos		neg		is not flapping 		the lid also locks so it is not flapping around in the wind 
pos		pos		does on a 		it 's compact but does what the big boys does on a smaller scale 
pos		pos		we 've broken 		all in all , i would not recommend this maker unless you get it for some wonderful deal eta that one month later we 've broken the carafe 
pos		neg		over and hurt 		i sure like the ease of cleaning a floor without having to bend over and hurt my back i have an extra battery , so when one battery runs down , i just put it in the charger , put the already charged battery in and off i go again ! i just ca n't say enough good things about this vacuum cleaner everybody should have one 
neg		pos		out and broke 		last week the hinge to open the trash can finally gave out and broke 
neg		neg		was n't expecting 		although i was n't expecting the suction of an expensive vacuum , i was expecting just a little more suction 
neg		pos		, it burns 		and , we found it in the perfect shade of red that matched our other counter top appliances unfortunately , it burns everything put into the oven 
pos		neg		would n't come 		nice hot coffee but the next time i went to make a pot the water would n't come out 
pos		pos		wonderful toaster ! 		wonderful toaster ! 
pos		neg		ca n't see 		it is pretty solid plastic , so unless you are trying to bend it when pulling the trash bags out , i ca n't see how it would crack and break 
pos		pos		about 250 , 		at about 250 , it was a real bargain 
pos		pos		i will just 		i have nothing to compare it to , so i will just tell you our experience with it first of all , it bakes very well 
pos		pos		now and everything 		we have had it in the house for two months now and everything works great 
neg		pos		having a burned 		you 'll hear and see the drops and you will have to clean them c \) it brews too fast and then the coffee keeps being heated , until it starts having a burned taste

pos		pos		is good 		the charge on these batteries is good 
pos		neg		old white wal 		sure beats the heck out of our old white wal mart microwave 
neg		neg		do n't put 		if you do n't put the basket in just right \( no room for error \) you will have a flooded mess of coffee grounds 
neg		pos		disease and no 		no doubt looking for bread crumbs concerned with the prospect of disease and no way to clean the toaster , we had no choice but to discard our toaster and buy a new one we purchased a replacement four slice cuisinart and it arrived in a few days it was obvious it was not the same quality as our first cuisinart and the lift levers really feel cheap they feel like they might break at any moment 
pos		pos		a burr grinder 		using a burr grinder on the course setting seems to make the most flavorful coffee that is never bitter 
pos		pos		to take out 		the crumb tray is easy to take out and clean 
neg		neg		bread toasts evenly 		although the bread toasts evenly , the metal area surrounding the slots becomes so hot that i had a blister on my finger from a burn i sustained while just touching the area ! 
pos		pos		good , versatile 		good , versatile microwave 
neg		neg		after i threw 		i wanted a hands free trash container that would close after i threw something away , but i have to either close it manually , or wedge my toe under the pedal to get the lid the close

pos		pos		like the buttons 		i especially like the buttons and controls 
neg		neg		found a puddle 		the first one leaked after only a couple of uses so i returned that one update 3 24 13 note that these all leak i had to return another one and am now on my third i just found a puddle of water on the floor so i will try putting a towel under or around the washer 
pos		pos		this toaster 		absolutely love this toaster 
neg		neg		n't expect a 		overall the machine is light , easy to use , and out of the way when stored on its wall mount just do n't expect a miniature vacuum the brush on the front is innovative , but it is by no means a replacement for a rotary brush 
neg		pos		extra 20 and 		i think it 's worth to spend an extra 20 and have a solid coffee maker 
pos		pos		timely and efficient 		every aspect of this purchase was accomplished in a timely and efficient manner 
pos		pos		love it ! 		love it !

pos		pos		does n't stand 		while this garbage can is awesome in the beginning , it just does n't stand the test of time 
pos		pos		do n't mind 		dirt container is a little small , but i do n't mind emptying more often cause the thing works great 
pos		pos		trash no muss 		13 gal bags work well in the cans but when the can is full the bag is full also , there is not alot of extra space to tie the bag so if you could find a little bigger bag i would recommend it or use the 13 gal with the build in handles its so nice when you have something messy or sticky you just move your hand in front of it and it opens you drop your trash no muss no fuss 
pos		pos		a surprisingly large 		it also removes a surprisingly large amount of grit , which is hard to find in this price range 
pos		pos		is a handsome 		it is a good looking appearance and cabinet , and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well our unit does have a rather loud beep volume , and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other panasonic microwave models

neg		neg		injury the toast 		to add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent we 're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back that 's what we tried to do 
pos		pos		this is a 		for the money this is a great buy 
neg		pos		rusty knives 		great if you like rusty knives 
neg		neg		a couple of 		after a couple of month or so , the sensor is not working at all 
pos		neg		is n't as 		it 's not exactly difficult , but it certainly is n't as easy as tapping a digit or 3 to set a time directly it 's a high power machine so dialing it back makes sense quite often and that 's why it has the inverter feature 
neg		pos		is fairly big 		it is fairly big 
neg		neg		the only drawback 		the only drawback was that the retainer ring that was sent did not fit
