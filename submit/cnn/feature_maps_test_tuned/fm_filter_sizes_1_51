neg		pos		as our first 		no doubt looking for bread crumbs concerned with the prospect of disease and no way to clean the toaster , we had no choice but to discard our toaster and buy a new one we purchased a replacement four slice cuisinart and it arrived in a few days it was obvious it was not the same quality as our first cuisinart and the lift levers really feel cheap they feel like they might break at any moment 
pos		pos		flavorful coffee that 		using a burr grinder on the course setting seems to make the most flavorful coffee that is never bitter 
pos		pos		easy to take 		the crumb tray is easy to take out and clean

pos		pos		love this toaster 		absolutely love this toaster 
neg		neg		easy to use 		overall the machine is light , easy to use , and out of the way when stored on its wall mount just do n't expect a miniature vacuum the brush on the front is innovative , but it is by no means a replacement for a rotary brush 
neg		pos		solid coffee maker 		i think it 's worth to spend an extra 20 and have a solid coffee maker

pos		pos		great 		dirt container is a little small , but i do n't mind emptying more often cause the thing works great 
pos		pos		opens you drop 		13 gal bags work well in the cans but when the can is full the bag is full also , there is not alot of extra space to tie the bag so if you could find a little bigger bag i would recommend it or use the 13 gal with the build in handles its so nice when you have something messy or sticky you just move your hand in front of it and it opens you drop your trash no muss no fuss 
pos		pos		removes a surprisingly 		it also removes a surprisingly large amount of grit , which is hard to find in this price range 
pos		pos		nice to be 		it is a good looking appearance and cabinet , and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well our unit does have a rather loud beep volume , and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other panasonic microwave models

neg		neg		to add insult 		to add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent we 're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back that 's what we tried to do
