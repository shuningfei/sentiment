pos		pos		egg , all 		it toasts my toast and poaches my egg , all in a very straight forward fashion 
neg		pos		was n't really 		so , another problem with me is that i tend to throw away packaging whenever i purchase something , so there was n't really an easy way to return this toaster 
neg		pos		lack of suction 		even though this is an inexpensive stick vacuum i was still surprised by the lack of suction power , especially for a plug in model 
pos		neg		is plenty dark 		at the end , lightly tamp before pulling the shot d \) the espresso is plenty dark 
pos		pos		gift for a 		great gift for a kid 
neg		neg		means nothing anymore 		the brand name means nothing anymore with the cruddy products they 've released like this toaster

neg		pos		one of those 		i used one of those plates for microwaving bacon and it just barely fit 
neg		neg		and auto shut 		had maker for approx 1 month and auto shut down started acting up 
neg		neg		difficult to shut 		however , in the case of this microwave , it is really quite difficult to shut the door without touching the stainless would have been more convenient for a small touch pad on the door to avoid having to constantly wipe off the smudges 
neg		pos		not a dog 		not a dog proof design 
pos		pos		little trash can 		great little trash can ! 
pos		pos		it 's built 		it does what it 's built to do it 's much lighter in weight than my old eureka boss that died last year and it has tremendous suction power

pos		pos		if it breaks 		if it breaks i would likely purchase another and will continue to recommend this model to friends 
neg		pos		that you lay 		also , the the wire grill that you lay the item you want toasted \( or baked \) on , has a hook on it , which enables it to slide out as you open the door , but many times does not close very smoothly , you have to jimmie it a bit to close 
pos		pos		pleasure to look 		what a pleasure to look on amazon and in two days it was on my door step 
pos		pos		a laundry mat 		for a year we 've gone to a laundry mat with no a c every week and spend 25 30 
pos		neg		n't get the 		it does n't get the little food stains out of my tees , but it does get everything else out smells , grease , etc 
pos		pos		out of frustration 		this is an update two years later \( 01 13 \) still working as described below keeps going and going i'm writing this review out of frustration re trying to find a new toaster , and we 're now going to keep this one , and you may want to give it a try , too 
pos		pos		they smell so 		they smell so fresh 
pos		pos		without getting so 		the new technology is great , i use sensor reheat quite frequently , it heats my dishes up nicely without getting so hot it burns you 
pos		pos		stainless steel microwave 		this is a very large stainless steel microwave 
neg		pos		and would turn 		it quit brewing ful pots and would turn off as soon as it was done brewing 
pos		pos		and it makes 		and it makes perfect toast , each and every time my family lives on bread 
pos		pos		a good microwave 		this is a good microwave and very reasonably priced 
pos		pos		a plus ! 		two batteries a plus ! 
neg		neg		the outlet hose 		a plug for the outlet hose would be nice , but a wad of paper blocks it ok 
neg		pos		now is broken 		this product is really attractive , basically easy to use , but used up batteries very fast and now is broken 
pos		pos		this makes perfect 		this makes perfect perfect coffee every time 
pos		pos		but can handle 		larger than most models , but can handle larger dishes , turntable helps cook food more evenly 
neg		neg		condensation will pour 		everything works as advertised with a few minor exceptions when you open the lid to remove yesterdays grounds , the water condensation will pour off the lid onto your counter , also adding the water can be interesting if you use the carafe , it 's a dribbler 
pos		pos		i wake up 		for the most part , i love it the good i love the program feature coffee is all made when i wake up 
pos		pos		do they do 		i simply can not believe how great this set is for so little money \? super sharp , well balanced , attractive , seemingly great quality how do they do it \? 
pos		pos		what i payed 		i would say that , for what i payed for it , the wonderwash \( er \) is an excellent supplemental tool i have mine on my kitchen counter and it is very useful as i am a single man who only sporadically can make it to the laundromat 
pos		pos		it 's really 		the controls are great , it 's really good looking , and it works fine 
pos		neg		mart that did 		i purchased this toaster after buying a cheaper one at wal mart that did not work 
pos		pos		a nice micrwave 		its a nice micrwave for the price , easy to use and works well 
neg		neg		out of the 		but for anything even slightly out of the ordinary , it just plain does n't work 
pos		pos		a time due 		we can cook more than one item at a time due to its large capacity , which is a real time saver ! 
pos		pos		we 'll have 		if it 's durable , we 'll have this one for a long time 
neg		pos		cup of espresso 		my 20 mocha makes a better cup of espresso , no question there 
neg		pos		if you put 		i decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews it generally works as described the main annoying thing \( which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan \) is it appears to have a 15 20 second after use pause so if you put something in , and immediately want to throw something else away , you either have to wait what seems like forever , or open it by hand my previous sensor can would immediately open again if i went to it again within 1 3 seconds 
neg		pos		instead of defrost 		defrost should be call cook instead of defrost 
pos		pos		a cute oven 		this is a cute oven 
neg		neg		a time consuming 		or worse , when we had several small handfuls to deposit into the bin , it would close right before we tossed the next load in , necessitating a time consuming cleanup eventually we turned off the bloody infrared sensor , and now manually raise and close the lid 
pos		pos		the little flip 		and it works great for those applications the little flip out brush and pull out extended reach tube are very well thought out 
pos		pos		it 's easy 		it 's easy to put the bags in and out 
pos		neg		not flapping around 		the lid also locks so it is not flapping around in the wind 
pos		pos		what the big 		it 's compact but does what the big boys does on a smaller scale 
pos		pos		broken the carafe 		all in all , i would not recommend this maker unless you get it for some wonderful deal eta that one month later we 've broken the carafe 
pos		neg		ca n't say 		i sure like the ease of cleaning a floor without having to bend over and hurt my back i have an extra battery , so when one battery runs down , i just put it in the charger , put the already charged battery in and off i go again ! i just ca n't say enough good things about this vacuum cleaner everybody should have one 
neg		pos		week the hinge 		last week the hinge to open the trash can finally gave out and broke 
neg		neg		was n't expecting 		although i was n't expecting the suction of an expensive vacuum , i was expecting just a little more suction 
neg		pos		, it burns 		and , we found it in the perfect shade of red that matched our other counter top appliances unfortunately , it burns everything put into the oven 
pos		neg		n't come out 		nice hot coffee but the next time i went to make a pot the water would n't come out 
pos		pos		wonderful toaster ! 		wonderful toaster ! 
pos		neg		ca n't see 		it is pretty solid plastic , so unless you are trying to bend it when pulling the trash bags out , i ca n't see how it would crack and break 
pos		pos		a real bargain 		at about 250 , it was a real bargain 
pos		pos		first of all 		i have nothing to compare it to , so i will just tell you our experience with it first of all , it bakes very well 
pos		pos		have had it 		we have had it in the house for two months now and everything works great 
neg		pos		having a burned 		you 'll hear and see the drops and you will have to clean them c \) it brews too fast and then the coffee keeps being heated , until it starts having a burned taste 
pos		pos		this little washer 		there is so much that you can do with this little washer

pos		neg		out of our 		sure beats the heck out of our old white wal mart microwave 
neg		neg		mess of coffee 		if you do n't put the basket in just right \( no room for error \) you will have a flooded mess of coffee grounds 
neg		pos		the lift levers 		no doubt looking for bread crumbs concerned with the prospect of disease and no way to clean the toaster , we had no choice but to discard our toaster and buy a new one we purchased a replacement four slice cuisinart and it arrived in a few days it was obvious it was not the same quality as our first cuisinart and the lift levers really feel cheap they feel like they might break at any moment 
pos		pos		a burr grinder 		using a burr grinder on the course setting seems to make the most flavorful coffee that is never bitter 
pos		pos		the crumb tray 		the crumb tray is easy to take out and clean 
neg		neg		from a burn 		although the bread toasts evenly , the metal area surrounding the slots becomes so hot that i had a blister on my finger from a burn i sustained while just touching the area ! 
pos		pos		good , versatile 		good , versatile microwave 
neg		neg		but i have 		i wanted a hands free trash container that would close after i threw something away , but i have to either close it manually , or wedge my toe under the pedal to get the lid the close 
pos		pos		never let us 		we have used this oven almost daily for nearly 6 years now and it has never let us down 
pos		pos		buttons and controls 		i especially like the buttons and controls 
neg		neg		puddle of water 		the first one leaked after only a couple of uses so i returned that one update 3 24 13 note that these all leak i had to return another one and am now on my third i just found a puddle of water on the floor so i will try putting a towel under or around the washer 
pos		pos		absolutely love this 		absolutely love this toaster 
neg		neg		vacuum the brush 		overall the machine is light , easy to use , and out of the way when stored on its wall mount just do n't expect a miniature vacuum the brush on the front is innovative , but it is by no means a replacement for a rotary brush 
neg		pos		have a solid 		i think it 's worth to spend an extra 20 and have a solid coffee maker 
pos		pos		aspect of this 		every aspect of this purchase was accomplished in a timely and efficient manner 
pos		pos		love it ! 		love it !

pos		pos		the hoover stick 		the hoover stick works very well 
pos		pos		be worthwhile , 		when you consider the ingredient costs vs a mc breakfast , it really does n't have to last that long to be worthwhile , not to mention the convenience and health benefits

pos		pos		does n't stand 		while this garbage can is awesome in the beginning , it just does n't stand the test of time 
pos		pos		n't mind emptying 		dirt container is a little small , but i do n't mind emptying more often cause the thing works great 
pos		pos		no muss no 		13 gal bags work well in the cans but when the can is full the bag is full also , there is not alot of extra space to tie the bag so if you could find a little bigger bag i would recommend it or use the 13 gal with the build in handles its so nice when you have something messy or sticky you just move your hand in front of it and it opens you drop your trash no muss no fuss 
pos		pos		amount of grit 		it also removes a surprisingly large amount of grit , which is hard to find in this price range 
pos		pos		a handsome affect 		it is a good looking appearance and cabinet , and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well our unit does have a rather loud beep volume , and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other panasonic microwave models 
neg		pos		and they are 		another set i have had for 5 years came from ikea and they are still going strong let 's see how long these last 
pos		pos		black with white 		black with white lettering is very attractive 
pos		pos		and they create 		some days it 's bagels , others are english muffins and they create the best mcmuffins i 've had 
neg		neg		wo n't lift 		we are good customers and did everything we were told to do and we 're left with a damaged product which was broken out of the box and panasonic wo n't lift a finger to help avoid at all costs 
neg		neg		instead of building 		to add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent we 're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back that 's what we tried to do 
pos		pos		money this is 		for the money this is a great buy 
neg		pos		like rusty knives 		great if you like rusty knives 
neg		neg		a couple of 		after a couple of month or so , the sensor is not working at all 
pos		neg		not exactly difficult 		it 's not exactly difficult , but it certainly is n't as easy as tapping a digit or 3 to set a time directly it 's a high power machine so dialing it back makes sense quite often and that 's why it has the inverter feature 
neg		pos		is fairly big 		it is fairly big
