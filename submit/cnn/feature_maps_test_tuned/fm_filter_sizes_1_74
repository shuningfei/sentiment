neg		pos		of those plates 		i used one of those plates for microwaving bacon and it just barely fit 
neg		neg		auto shut down 		had maker for approx 1 month and auto shut down started acting up 
neg		neg		the stainless would 		however , in the case of this microwave , it is really quite difficult to shut the door without touching the stainless would have been more convenient for a small touch pad on the door to avoid having to constantly wipe off the smudges

neg		pos		a bit to 		also , the the wire grill that you lay the item you want toasted \( or baked \) on , has a hook on it , which enables it to slide out as you open the door , but many times does not close very smoothly , you have to jimmie it a bit to close

pos		pos		they smell so 		they smell so fresh 
pos		pos		burns you 		the new technology is great , i use sensor reheat quite frequently , it heats my dishes up nicely without getting so hot it burns you 
pos		pos		large stainless steel 		this is a very large stainless steel microwave 
neg		pos		brewing ful pots 		it quit brewing ful pots and would turn off as soon as it was done brewing 
pos		pos		bread 		and it makes perfect toast , each and every time my family lives on bread 
pos		pos		a good microwave 		this is a good microwave and very reasonably priced 
pos		pos		a plus ! 		two batteries a plus ! 
neg		neg		it ok 		a plug for the outlet hose would be nice , but a wad of paper blocks it ok

pos		pos		coffee every time 		this makes perfect perfect coffee every time 
pos		pos		evenly 		larger than most models , but can handle larger dishes , turntable helps cook food more evenly 
neg		neg		remove yesterdays grounds 		everything works as advertised with a few minor exceptions when you open the lid to remove yesterdays grounds , the water condensation will pour off the lid onto your counter , also adding the water can be interesting if you use the carafe , it 's a dribbler 
pos		pos		when i wake 		for the most part , i love it the good i love the program feature coffee is all made when i wake up 
pos		pos		do it \? 		i simply can not believe how great this set is for so little money \? super sharp , well balanced , attractive , seemingly great quality how do they do it \? 
pos		pos		\( er \) 		i would say that , for what i payed for it , the wonderwash \( er \) is an excellent supplemental tool i have mine on my kitchen counter and it is very useful as i am a single man who only sporadically can make it to the laundromat

pos		pos		if it 's 		if it 's durable , we 'll have this one for a long time 
neg		pos		question there 		my 20 mocha makes a better cup of espresso , no question there 
neg		pos		if i went 		i decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews it generally works as described the main annoying thing \( which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan \) is it appears to have a 15 20 second after use pause so if you put something in , and immediately want to throw something else away , you either have to wait what seems like forever , or open it by hand my previous sensor can would immediately open again if i went to it again within 1 3 seconds 
neg		pos		be call cook 		defrost should be call cook instead of defrost 
pos		pos		this is a 		this is a cute oven 
neg		neg		handfuls to deposit 		or worse , when we had several small handfuls to deposit into the bin , it would close right before we tossed the next load in , necessitating a time consuming cleanup eventually we turned off the bloody infrared sensor , and now manually raise and close the lid 
pos		pos		flip out brush 		and it works great for those applications the little flip out brush and pull out extended reach tube are very well thought out

pos		pos		a smaller scale 		it 's compact but does what the big boys does on a smaller scale 
pos		pos		, i would 		all in all , i would not recommend this maker unless you get it for some wonderful deal eta that one month later we 've broken the carafe 
pos		neg		hurt my back 		i sure like the ease of cleaning a floor without having to bend over and hurt my back i have an extra battery , so when one battery runs down , i just put it in the charger , put the already charged battery in and off i go again ! i just ca n't say enough good things about this vacuum cleaner everybody should have one 
neg		pos		can finally gave 		last week the hinge to open the trash can finally gave out and broke 
neg		neg		although i was 		although i was n't expecting the suction of an expensive vacuum , i was expecting just a little more suction 
neg		pos		burns everything put 		and , we found it in the perfect shade of red that matched our other counter top appliances unfortunately , it burns everything put into the oven 
pos		neg		a pot the 		nice hot coffee but the next time i went to make a pot the water would n't come out 
pos		pos		wonderful toaster ! 		wonderful toaster ! 
pos		neg		, i ca 		it is pretty solid plastic , so unless you are trying to bend it when pulling the trash bags out , i ca n't see how it would crack and break 
pos		pos		about 250 , 		at about 250 , it was a real bargain 
pos		pos		so i will 		i have nothing to compare it to , so i will just tell you our experience with it first of all , it bakes very well

neg		neg		a flooded mess 		if you do n't put the basket in just right \( no room for error \) you will have a flooded mess of coffee grounds 
neg		pos		the lift levers 		no doubt looking for bread crumbs concerned with the prospect of disease and no way to clean the toaster , we had no choice but to discard our toaster and buy a new one we purchased a replacement four slice cuisinart and it arrived in a few days it was obvious it was not the same quality as our first cuisinart and the lift levers really feel cheap they feel like they might break at any moment 
pos		pos		a burr grinder 		using a burr grinder on the course setting seems to make the most flavorful coffee that is never bitter 
pos		pos		clean 		the crumb tray is easy to take out and clean 
neg		neg		burn i sustained 		although the bread toasts evenly , the metal area surrounding the slots becomes so hot that i had a blister on my finger from a burn i sustained while just touching the area ! 
pos		pos		good , versatile 		good , versatile microwave 
neg		neg		after i threw 		i wanted a hands free trash container that would close after i threw something away , but i have to either close it manually , or wedge my toe under the pedal to get the lid the close 
pos		pos		let us down 		we have used this oven almost daily for nearly 6 years now and it has never let us down 
pos		pos		buttons and controls 		i especially like the buttons and controls 
neg		neg		so i returned 		the first one leaked after only a couple of uses so i returned that one update 3 24 13 note that these all leak i had to return another one and am now on my third i just found a puddle of water on the floor so i will try putting a towel under or around the washer 
pos		pos		absolutely love this 		absolutely love this toaster 
neg		neg		a rotary brush 		overall the machine is light , easy to use , and out of the way when stored on its wall mount just do n't expect a miniature vacuum the brush on the front is innovative , but it is by no means a replacement for a rotary brush 
neg		pos		coffee maker 		i think it 's worth to spend an extra 20 and have a solid coffee maker 
pos		pos		manner 		every aspect of this purchase was accomplished in a timely and efficient manner

pos		pos		often cause the 		dirt container is a little small , but i do n't mind emptying more often cause the thing works great 
pos		pos		drop your trash 		13 gal bags work well in the cans but when the can is full the bag is full also , there is not alot of extra space to tie the bag so if you could find a little bigger bag i would recommend it or use the 13 gal with the build in handles its so nice when you have something messy or sticky you just move your hand in front of it and it opens you drop your trash no muss no fuss 
pos		pos		a surprisingly large 		it also removes a surprisingly large amount of grit , which is hard to find in this price range 
pos		pos		a handsome affect 		it is a good looking appearance and cabinet , and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well our unit does have a rather loud beep volume , and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other panasonic microwave models

neg		neg		insult to injury 		to add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent we 're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back that 's what we tried to do
