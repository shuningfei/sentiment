neg		pos		better cup of 		my 20 mocha makes a better cup of espresso , no question there 
neg		pos		what seems like 		i decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews it generally works as described the main annoying thing \( which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan \) is it appears to have a 15 20 second after use pause so if you put something in , and immediately want to throw something else away , you either have to wait what seems like forever , or open it by hand my previous sensor can would immediately open again if i went to it again within 1 3 seconds

pos		pos		burr grinder on 		using a burr grinder on the course setting seems to make the most flavorful coffee that is never bitter 
pos		pos		is easy to 		the crumb tray is easy to take out and clean

pos		pos		love this toaster 		absolutely love this toaster 
neg		neg		it is by 		overall the machine is light , easy to use , and out of the way when stored on its wall mount just do n't expect a miniature vacuum the brush on the front is innovative , but it is by no means a replacement for a rotary brush 
neg		pos		's worth to 		i think it 's worth to spend an extra 20 and have a solid coffee maker

pos		pos		your trash no 		13 gal bags work well in the cans but when the can is full the bag is full also , there is not alot of extra space to tie the bag so if you could find a little bigger bag i would recommend it or use the 13 gal with the build in handles its so nice when you have something messy or sticky you just move your hand in front of it and it opens you drop your trash no muss no fuss 
pos		pos		this price range 		it also removes a surprisingly large amount of grit , which is hard to find in this price range 
pos		pos		as is an 		it is a good looking appearance and cabinet , and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well our unit does have a rather loud beep volume , and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other panasonic microwave models

neg		neg		we 're inclined 		to add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent we 're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back that 's what we tried to do
