neg		pos		better cup of 		my 20 mocha makes a better cup of espresso , no question there 
neg		pos		good reviews it 		i decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews it generally works as described the main annoying thing \( which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan \) is it appears to have a 15 20 second after use pause so if you put something in , and immediately want to throw something else away , you either have to wait what seems like forever , or open it by hand my previous sensor can would immediately open again if i went to it again within 1 3 seconds

neg		pos		to clean the 		no doubt looking for bread crumbs concerned with the prospect of disease and no way to clean the toaster , we had no choice but to discard our toaster and buy a new one we purchased a replacement four slice cuisinart and it arrived in a few days it was obvious it was not the same quality as our first cuisinart and the lift levers really feel cheap they feel like they might break at any moment 
pos		pos		most flavorful coffee 		using a burr grinder on the course setting seems to make the most flavorful coffee that is never bitter 
pos		pos		the crumb tray 		the crumb tray is easy to take out and clean

pos		pos		love this toaster 		absolutely love this toaster 
neg		pos		a miniature vacuum 		overall the machine is light , easy to use , and out of the way when stored on its wall mount just do n't expect a miniature vacuum the brush on the front is innovative , but it is by no means a replacement for a rotary brush 
neg		pos		a solid coffee 		i think it 's worth to spend an extra 20 and have a solid coffee maker 
pos		pos		this purchase was 		every aspect of this purchase was accomplished in a timely and efficient manner

pos		pos		mind emptying more 		dirt container is a little small , but i do n't mind emptying more often cause the thing works great 
pos		pos		bigger bag i 		13 gal bags work well in the cans but when the can is full the bag is full also , there is not alot of extra space to tie the bag so if you could find a little bigger bag i would recommend it or use the 13 gal with the build in handles its so nice when you have something messy or sticky you just move your hand in front of it and it opens you drop your trash no muss no fuss 
pos		pos		large amount of 		it also removes a surprisingly large amount of grit , which is hard to find in this price range 
pos		pos		loud beep volume 		it is a good looking appearance and cabinet , and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well our unit does have a rather loud beep volume , and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other panasonic microwave models

neg		neg		what we tried 		to add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent we 're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back that 's what we tried to do

neg		pos		like rusty knives 		great if you like rusty knives 
neg		neg		the sensor is 		after a couple of month or so , the sensor is not working at all 
pos		neg		to set a 		it 's not exactly difficult , but it certainly is n't as easy as tapping a digit or 3 to set a time directly it 's a high power machine so dialing it back makes sense quite often and that 's why it has the inverter feature 
neg		pos		big 		it is fairly big
