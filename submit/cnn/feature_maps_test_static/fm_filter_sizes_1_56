neg		neg		approx 1 month 		had maker for approx 1 month and auto shut down started acting up 
neg		neg		touch pad on 		however , in the case of this microwave , it is really quite difficult to shut the door without touching the stainless would have been more convenient for a small touch pad on the door to avoid having to constantly wipe off the smudges

neg		neg		water condensation will 		everything works as advertised with a few minor exceptions when you open the lid to remove yesterdays grounds , the water condensation will pour off the lid onto your counter , also adding the water can be interesting if you use the carafe , it 's a dribbler

neg		neg		the ordinary , 		but for anything even slightly out of the ordinary , it just plain does n't work 
pos		pos		large capacity , 		we can cook more than one item at a time due to its large capacity , which is a real time saver ! 
pos		pos		's durable , 		if it 's durable , we 'll have this one for a long time 
neg		pos		cup of espresso 		my 20 mocha makes a better cup of espresso , no question there 
neg		pos		3 seconds 		i decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews it generally works as described the main annoying thing \( which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan \) is it appears to have a 15 20 second after use pause so if you put something in , and immediately want to throw something else away , you either have to wait what seems like forever , or open it by hand my previous sensor can would immediately open again if i went to it again within 1 3 seconds 
neg		pos		of defrost 		defrost should be call cook instead of defrost 
pos		pos		cute oven 		this is a cute oven 
neg		neg		infrared sensor , 		or worse , when we had several small handfuls to deposit into the bin , it would close right before we tossed the next load in , necessitating a time consuming cleanup eventually we turned off the bloody infrared sensor , and now manually raise and close the lid

pos		pos		's compact but 		it 's compact but does what the big boys does on a smaller scale 
pos		pos		in all , 		all in all , i would not recommend this maker unless you get it for some wonderful deal eta that one month later we 've broken the carafe 
pos		neg		extra battery , 		i sure like the ease of cleaning a floor without having to bend over and hurt my back i have an extra battery , so when one battery runs down , i just put it in the charger , put the already charged battery in and off i go again ! i just ca n't say enough good things about this vacuum cleaner everybody should have one 
neg		pos		the trash can 		last week the hinge to open the trash can finally gave out and broke 
neg		neg		expensive vacuum , 		although i was n't expecting the suction of an expensive vacuum , i was expecting just a little more suction 
neg		pos		the perfect shade 		and , we found it in the perfect shade of red that matched our other counter top appliances unfortunately , it burns everything put into the oven 
pos		neg		nice hot coffee 		nice hot coffee but the next time i went to make a pot the water would n't come out 
pos		pos		wonderful toaster ! 		wonderful toaster !

pos		pos		about 250 , 		at about 250 , it was a real bargain 
pos		pos		, it bakes 		i have nothing to compare it to , so i will just tell you our experience with it first of all , it bakes very well

neg		neg		mess of coffee 		if you do n't put the basket in just right \( no room for error \) you will have a flooded mess of coffee grounds 
neg		pos		the toaster , 		no doubt looking for bread crumbs concerned with the prospect of disease and no way to clean the toaster , we had no choice but to discard our toaster and buy a new one we purchased a replacement four slice cuisinart and it arrived in a few days it was obvious it was not the same quality as our first cuisinart and the lift levers really feel cheap they feel like they might break at any moment 
pos		pos		burr grinder on 		using a burr grinder on the course setting seems to make the most flavorful coffee that is never bitter 
pos		pos		out and clean 		the crumb tray is easy to take out and clean 
neg		neg		toasts evenly , 		although the bread toasts evenly , the metal area surrounding the slots becomes so hot that i had a blister on my finger from a burn i sustained while just touching the area ! 
pos		pos		, versatile microwave 		good , versatile microwave 
neg		neg		it manually , 		i wanted a hands free trash container that would close after i threw something away , but i have to either close it manually , or wedge my toe under the pedal to get the lid the close

pos		pos		this toaster 		absolutely love this toaster 
neg		pos		is light , 		overall the machine is light , easy to use , and out of the way when stored on its wall mount just do n't expect a miniature vacuum the brush on the front is innovative , but it is by no means a replacement for a rotary brush 
neg		pos		spend an extra 		i think it 's worth to spend an extra 20 and have a solid coffee maker 
pos		pos		timely and efficient 		every aspect of this purchase was accomplished in a timely and efficient manner 
pos		pos		it ! 		love it !

pos		pos		the beginning , 		while this garbage can is awesome in the beginning , it just does n't stand the test of time 
pos		pos		dirt container is 		dirt container is a little small , but i do n't mind emptying more often cause the thing works great 
pos		pos		gal bags work 		13 gal bags work well in the cans but when the can is full the bag is full also , there is not alot of extra space to tie the bag so if you could find a little bigger bag i would recommend it or use the 13 gal with the build in handles its so nice when you have something messy or sticky you just move your hand in front of it and it opens you drop your trash no muss no fuss 
pos		pos		of grit , 		it also removes a surprisingly large amount of grit , which is hard to find in this price range 
pos		pos		clock and readout 		it is a good looking appearance and cabinet , and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well our unit does have a rather loud beep volume , and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other panasonic microwave models

neg		neg		it and buy 		to add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent we 're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back that 's what we tried to do 
pos		pos		this is a 		for the money this is a great buy 
neg		pos		rusty knives 		great if you like rusty knives 
neg		neg		, the sensor 		after a couple of month or so , the sensor is not working at all 
pos		neg		a digit or 		it 's not exactly difficult , but it certainly is n't as easy as tapping a digit or 3 to set a time directly it 's a high power machine so dialing it back makes sense quite often and that 's why it has the inverter feature 
neg		pos		fairly big 		it is fairly big

pos		pos		occassions and , 		worse comes to worse you can take out the 6 d batteries that should last for years if the kiddies figure out the on off button but that 's unlikely it has a stay open button as well , for those busy occassions and , they both stay as clean as you choose to keep them because it 's so easy to hit the mark every time !
