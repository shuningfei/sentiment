pos		pos		surely are very 		the knives surely are very sharp 
pos		pos		this trash can 		this trash can solves both problems

pos		pos		chicago cutlery quality 		chicago cutlery quality and the in block sharpener works very nicely 
pos		pos		and is quite 		this new microwave has so many new features and is quite simple to use once you get cooking with it 
pos		pos		the linx ! 		grab the linx ! 
pos		pos		think they fit 		i use 13 gallon trash bags \( regular drawstring kind , not simplehuman trash bags \) and i think they fit really well 
pos		pos		good qualityand very 		good qualityand very nice to use , my mother very happy when she used itthank you very muchbyer 
pos		pos		buy a dualit 		now let me say this if you 're interested in toast , never buy a dualit toaster 
pos		pos		, and very 		easy set up , and very easy to use 
pos		pos		a very sturdy 		i was a little skeptical at first , especially after reading that the material is plastic , but this is a very sturdy and somewhat stylish toaster 
pos		pos		2 servings of 		it is large enough to make 2 servings of fries or tater tots 
pos		pos		size is perfect 		the size is perfect and it even looks nice 
pos		pos		we like it 		we like it 
pos		pos		a kitchen essential 		a kitchen essential highly recommended 
pos		pos		poaches my egg 		it toasts my toast and poaches my egg , all in a very straight forward fashion 
neg		neg		throw away packaging 		so , another problem with me is that i tend to throw away packaging whenever i purchase something , so there was n't really an easy way to return this toaster 
neg		pos		an inexpensive stick 		even though this is an inexpensive stick vacuum i was still surprised by the lack of suction power , especially for a plug in model 
pos		neg		the shot d 		at the end , lightly tamp before pulling the shot d \) the espresso is plenty dark 
pos		pos		gift for a 		great gift for a kid 
neg		neg		've released like 		the brand name means nothing anymore with the cruddy products they 've released like this toaster

pos		pos		easy to use 		easy to use 
neg		pos		just barely fit 		i used one of those plates for microwaving bacon and it just barely fit 
neg		neg		maker for approx 		had maker for approx 1 month and auto shut down started acting up 
neg		neg		small touch pad 		however , in the case of this microwave , it is really quite difficult to shut the door without touching the stainless would have been more convenient for a small touch pad on the door to avoid having to constantly wipe off the smudges 
neg		pos		not a dog 		not a dog proof design 
pos		pos		trash can ! 		great little trash can ! 
pos		pos		lighter in weight 		it does what it 's built to do it 's much lighter in weight than my old eureka boss that died last year and it has tremendous suction power 
neg		neg		auto shut off 		second , if the machine is left on , it does not have an auto shut off function and may overheat , so be careful 
pos		pos		recommend this model 		if it breaks i would likely purchase another and will continue to recommend this model to friends 
neg		pos		not close very 		also , the the wire grill that you lay the item you want toasted \( or baked \) on , has a hook on it , which enables it to slide out as you open the door , but many times does not close very smoothly , you have to jimmie it a bit to close 
pos		pos		pleasure to look 		what a pleasure to look on amazon and in two days it was on my door step

pos		pos		they smell so 		they smell so fresh 
pos		pos		i use sensor 		the new technology is great , i use sensor reheat quite frequently , it heats my dishes up nicely without getting so hot it burns you 
pos		pos		very large stainless 		this is a very large stainless steel microwave 
neg		pos		quit brewing ful 		it quit brewing ful pots and would turn off as soon as it was done brewing 
pos		pos		every time my 		and it makes perfect toast , each and every time my family lives on bread 
pos		pos		and very reasonably 		this is a good microwave and very reasonably priced 
pos		pos		a plus ! 		two batteries a plus ! 
neg		neg		nice , but 		a plug for the outlet hose would be nice , but a wad of paper blocks it ok 
neg		pos		up batteries very 		this product is really attractive , basically easy to use , but used up batteries very fast and now is broken 
pos		pos		perfect coffee every 		this makes perfect perfect coffee every time 
pos		pos		helps cook food 		larger than most models , but can handle larger dishes , turntable helps cook food more evenly 
neg		neg		everything works as 		everything works as advertised with a few minor exceptions when you open the lid to remove yesterdays grounds , the water condensation will pour off the lid onto your counter , also adding the water can be interesting if you use the carafe , it 's a dribbler 
pos		pos		feature coffee is 		for the most part , i love it the good i love the program feature coffee is all made when i wake up 
pos		pos		believe how great 		i simply can not believe how great this set is for so little money \? super sharp , well balanced , attractive , seemingly great quality how do they do it \? 
pos		pos		only sporadically can 		i would say that , for what i payed for it , the wonderwash \( er \) is an excellent supplemental tool i have mine on my kitchen counter and it is very useful as i am a single man who only sporadically can make it to the laundromat 
pos		pos		it works fine 		the controls are great , it 's really good looking , and it works fine 
pos		neg		i purchased this 		i purchased this toaster after buying a cheaper one at wal mart that did not work 
pos		pos		and works well 		its a nice micrwave for the price , easy to use and works well 
neg		neg		anything even slightly 		but for anything even slightly out of the ordinary , it just plain does n't work 
pos		pos		time saver ! 		we can cook more than one item at a time due to its large capacity , which is a real time saver ! 
pos		pos		it 's durable 		if it 's durable , we 'll have this one for a long time 
neg		pos		better cup of 		my 20 mocha makes a better cup of espresso , no question there 
neg		pos		reviews it generally 		i decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews it generally works as described the main annoying thing \( which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan \) is it appears to have a 15 20 second after use pause so if you put something in , and immediately want to throw something else away , you either have to wait what seems like forever , or open it by hand my previous sensor can would immediately open again if i went to it again within 1 3 seconds 
neg		pos		defrost should be 		defrost should be call cook instead of defrost 
pos		pos		this is a 		this is a cute oven 
neg		neg		bloody infrared sensor 		or worse , when we had several small handfuls to deposit into the bin , it would close right before we tossed the next load in , necessitating a time consuming cleanup eventually we turned off the bloody infrared sensor , and now manually raise and close the lid 
pos		pos		it works great 		and it works great for those applications the little flip out brush and pull out extended reach tube are very well thought out 
pos		pos		put the bags 		it 's easy to put the bags in and out 
pos		neg		lid also locks 		the lid also locks so it is not flapping around in the wind 
pos		pos		a smaller scale 		it 's compact but does what the big boys does on a smaller scale 
pos		pos		recommend this maker 		all in all , i would not recommend this maker unless you get it for some wonderful deal eta that one month later we 've broken the carafe 
pos		neg		go again ! 		i sure like the ease of cleaning a floor without having to bend over and hurt my back i have an extra battery , so when one battery runs down , i just put it in the charger , put the already charged battery in and off i go again ! i just ca n't say enough good things about this vacuum cleaner everybody should have one 
neg		pos		the trash can 		last week the hinge to open the trash can finally gave out and broke 
neg		neg		expecting the suction 		although i was n't expecting the suction of an expensive vacuum , i was expecting just a little more suction 
neg		pos		red that matched 		and , we found it in the perfect shade of red that matched our other counter top appliances unfortunately , it burns everything put into the oven 
pos		neg		next time i 		nice hot coffee but the next time i went to make a pot the water would n't come out 
pos		pos		wonderful toaster ! 		wonderful toaster ! 
pos		neg		the trash bags 		it is pretty solid plastic , so unless you are trying to bend it when pulling the trash bags out , i ca n't see how it would crack and break 
pos		pos		at about 250 		at about 250 , it was a real bargain 
pos		pos		it bakes very 		i have nothing to compare it to , so i will just tell you our experience with it first of all , it bakes very well 
pos		pos		everything works great 		we have had it in the house for two months now and everything works great 
neg		pos		coffee keeps being 		you 'll hear and see the drops and you will have to clean them c \) it brews too fast and then the coffee keeps being heated , until it starts having a burned taste

neg		neg		will have a 		if you do n't put the basket in just right \( no room for error \) you will have a flooded mess of coffee grounds 
neg		pos		the same quality 		no doubt looking for bread crumbs concerned with the prospect of disease and no way to clean the toaster , we had no choice but to discard our toaster and buy a new one we purchased a replacement four slice cuisinart and it arrived in a few days it was obvious it was not the same quality as our first cuisinart and the lift levers really feel cheap they feel like they might break at any moment 
pos		pos		coffee that is 		using a burr grinder on the course setting seems to make the most flavorful coffee that is never bitter 
pos		pos		take out and 		the crumb tray is easy to take out and clean 
neg		neg		a burn i 		although the bread toasts evenly , the metal area surrounding the slots becomes so hot that i had a blister on my finger from a burn i sustained while just touching the area ! 
pos		pos		good , versatile 		good , versatile microwave 
neg		neg		free trash container 		i wanted a hands free trash container that would close after i threw something away , but i have to either close it manually , or wedge my toe under the pedal to get the lid the close 
pos		pos		have used this 		we have used this oven almost daily for nearly 6 years now and it has never let us down 
pos		pos		like the buttons 		i especially like the buttons and controls

pos		pos		absolutely love this 		absolutely love this toaster 
neg		pos		expect a miniature 		overall the machine is light , easy to use , and out of the way when stored on its wall mount just do n't expect a miniature vacuum the brush on the front is innovative , but it is by no means a replacement for a rotary brush 
neg		pos		spend an extra 		i think it 's worth to spend an extra 20 and have a solid coffee maker 
pos		pos		accomplished in a 		every aspect of this purchase was accomplished in a timely and efficient manner 
pos		pos		love it ! 		love it !

pos		pos		this garbage can 		while this garbage can is awesome in the beginning , it just does n't stand the test of time 
pos		pos		thing works great 		dirt container is a little small , but i do n't mind emptying more often cause the thing works great 
pos		pos		bigger bag i 		13 gal bags work well in the cans but when the can is full the bag is full also , there is not alot of extra space to tie the bag so if you could find a little bigger bag i would recommend it or use the 13 gal with the build in handles its so nice when you have something messy or sticky you just move your hand in front of it and it opens you drop your trash no muss no fuss 
pos		pos		this price range 		it also removes a surprisingly large amount of grit , which is hard to find in this price range 
pos		pos		loud beep volume 		it is a good looking appearance and cabinet , and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well our unit does have a rather loud beep volume , and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other panasonic microwave models

neg		neg		dry and inconsistent 		to add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent we 're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back that 's what we tried to do 
pos		pos		the money this 		for the money this is a great buy 
neg		pos		like rusty knives 		great if you like rusty knives 
neg		neg		not working at 		after a couple of month or so , the sensor is not working at all 
pos		neg		to set a 		it 's not exactly difficult , but it certainly is n't as easy as tapping a digit or 3 to set a time directly it 's a high power machine so dialing it back makes sense quite often and that 's why it has the inverter feature 
neg		pos		it is fairly 		it is fairly big 
neg		neg		did not fit 		the only drawback was that the retainer ring that was sent did not fit

pos		pos		every time ! 		worse comes to worse you can take out the 6 d batteries that should last for years if the kiddies figure out the on off button but that 's unlikely it has a stay open button as well , for those busy occassions and , they both stay as clean as you choose to keep them because it 's so easy to hit the mark every time !
