pos		pos		hose tube attached 		it 's also one of the only vacuum cleaners that has a hose tube attached in a good location so it 's easy to use 
pos		pos		multiple features and 		good looking , multiple features and great performance 
pos		pos		sitting on my 		! another marvelous feature is the dual motor system , which means you can turn the roller off and simply use it for a vacuum , which is great for when you 're using the hose and do n't want to waste the power , put wear on the belt , and have the roller wearing out whatever it happens to be sitting on my only complaint , which is absolutely aesthetics every picture you see , on amazon , on the product box , and even on eureka 's website , shows a clear or smoke dust cup , which matches the color scheme of the upright we have

pos		pos		without being directly 		i'm very pleased with this product and i'm sure you will be as well providing you do n't confuse it with a full size unit the main reason i'm writing this is to mention , unlike the company 's customer service department claimed , it will work without being directly connected to a water source
