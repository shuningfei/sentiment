review text: This particular one would not turn on immediately when you push the on/off button. You had to push the other buttons (brew strength, keep warm temperature) a couple of times while holding your hand on the warming platform to feel whether the coil had begun to heat. Also the clock kept losing the time. I think it was just a faulty computer module on this particular one, so I returned it to Amazon and bought the exact same model again at a local store. If that one doesn't work either, then I'll know that it is a flaw in the design of this model, but if it does, I'll add a comment to this review and maybe upgrade the rating from 3 to 5.------------------After having bought the same unit at a local store, I can affirm that it works fine. Apparently the first one just had some electronic flaw. I prefer the Melitta brand and others like it, because you can use the cone-shaped Melitta filters in them, which in my opinion produce much better coffee than the flat Mr. Coffee style filters.

review text: I have had the coffeemaker for over a month and I am very pleased. I have had no problems with the hot water side. Very convenient and the water is very hot with no bad taste. I especially like the carafe warming plate. It has a low, medium and high setting. I keep the setting on low and it keeps the coffee plenty hot without affecting the taste. I am particularly sensitive to the "burned" taste of coffee after it has remained in a carafe after brewing - to the extent that I have always poured it into an insulated carafe immediately after brewing. Not necessary with this machine. My carafe does leak when I pour the water in but frankly, I have never had one that did not leak. I would recommend this machine without any reservations.

review text: This is by far the best coffee maker we ever owned its a little more expensive but its worth it.It doesn,t have a swing out filter holder like the others i used thus eliminating the sagging  basket.I recommend using a paper filter in the gold tone filter as it makes disposal a little easier.The self cleaning feature and reminder are very helpful.I highly recommend this coffee maker to everyone, happy brewing!:)

review text: You know, I was getting a little nuts reading the schizophrenic yet passionate reviews for the DCC-1200. It's hard to believe that one coffeemaker could elicit so many gushing positives and at the same time be lambasted for poor design/engineering.  Well, I made the leap and bought one last night, having just returned a new, fully-programmable, stainless steel,upper-end Mr. Coffee that functioned perfectly as a machine but maybe the taste of the coffee was a little plasticky. After reading the Cuisinart reviews, I felt it as a bit of a gamble to acquire more expensive, suspect machinery for the potential return of better tasting coffee. But the investment has totally paid off, at least in taste. The Cuisinart truly produces a warmer and much smoother cup of coffee than the upper-end Mr. Coffee, using the same pre-ground Folgers Custom Grind from Walmart, a finer than average grind. It is a notable difference, and I guess there is more to brewing coffee than just showering grounds with hot water.Perhaps Cuisinart has made improvements to the product over time,because the unit functions fine and cleans easily, though how it holds up over time remains to be seen.And now, retailers have just cut the base price from $99.99 to $79.99, and with a 20% off Bed,Bath & Beyond coupon, we're talking about a $64 dollar machine that looks great and brews a rich, smooth cup of coffee. You really can't go wrong with this, and the people who complain "you have to turn the knob to 'brew' AND THEN hit the 'on' switch!" need to quit being so...retentive and appreciate the larger picture of a better cup of coffee.

review text: I needed to replace my cuisinart stainless steel coffee maker and was hoping this would be a good replacement. It is nice that it is stainless steel and has options for brewing regular, bold or strong coffee. There are three things that are disappointing: one of the screws by coffee filter is already rusted after only one month. It is a really odd placement for a screw, to be inside where the coffee is brewed. The second thing that is when you lift the lid to remove the coffee filter, water drains down into the old filter and drips into the coffee pot. The third thing is that the water level on the side starts at 6 cups, which is an issue when making half a pot. If I hadn't had such a great coffee maker previously I may not have noticed the inconveniences with this one.

review text: I bought this espresso machine a little bit over 2 years ago, it has not given me any problems yet. Maintenance is the key, so make sure you clean it often and use decalcifier. I have been using Durgol Swiss Espresso Special Decalcifier, 2-Pack 4.2 fluid ounce Bottles, which does a great job and is relatively inexpensive, compared to the brand names.Pros:1) It is a low maintenance machine, the only thing you need to do is clean it.2) Easy to make coffee, cappuccino and espresso: just press a button and it's ready (unless you are making cappuccino, then using the steaming wand, it takes you less than 30 seconds)3) The decalcifying process is also easy. It takes 30 minutes to complete.Cons:1) To make relatively strong coffee you need to keep the settings on extra strong coffee and grind the beans very fine (there is a setting for that on the grinder)2) Coffee comes out warm-hot, but not very hot, so if you plan to add milk from the refrigerator, warm it in the microwave3) Espresso is not really that strong, compared to Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts, even on the highest settingOverall, I would highly recommend this espresso machine to people who want something fancier than a regular coffee maker or Keurig, but also want to keep it simple from the point of putting an effort to make a cup of coffee.Feel free to ask any questions.

review text: This is a nice entry-level Espresso machine. 15-bar of steam pressure is on the low end, but the result tastes good enough for me.It is easy to use and clean it. A 6oz cup of Cappuccino takes 3 minutes and 35 cents. It may not compare to gourmet espresso, but definitely tastes and smells much much better than regular brewed coffee. For casual coffee drinkers like myself, this is perfect.There are two minor issues with this machine, however. First, the water tank can be shaken loose and leak. If this happens, make sure the tank is pressed down firmly. Second, if the machine is left on, it does not have an auto-shut-off function and may overheat, so be careful.

review text: My last coffeemaker was purchased while I was in college and no matter how much I tried to clean it.. my coffee was coming out weird tasting. So I was on the hunt for a good coffee maker at a great price. I liked that there was an option when you're brewing fewer than 5 cups of coffee and that you could adjust the heat for the coffee carafe.The unit was easy to program and my coffee has tasted great. The gold filter is good, but I don't like ANY sediment in my coffee, so we double up with coffee filters which actually makes things a lot easier to clean. It's a little awkward to pour in the water and crane your head around to look at the water level which is toward the back of the unit, but I love that it comes with a charcoal filter to keep my coffee tasting good.The hot water side has been pretty convenient when I have company over that prefers tea or when I have a nostalgic craving for instant noodles. It doesn't take long at all for the water to heat. The level does seem a bit flimsy, but so far it hasn't snapped off.And finally.. since it's the boyfriend's job to make the coffee in the morning.. I definitely appreciate the "coffee's done" alarm.

review text: I love several features. This machine allows you to set the number of hours the pot stays on, control the heater plate and has a very comfortable design for the carafe itself. The temperature of the coffee is the best part. It's the perfect temperature every time.The machine beeps when the coffee is ready. The design is attractive. The water resevoir is easy to read and easy to fill.If I had to pick one thing that I don't like, it would be the total height of the machine. I have to pull the entire unit out from under the cupboards to lift the lid far enough to add coffee and water. If that's the only thing --- I'm good.

review text: I had two coffemakers. Made a pot of coffee once, maybe twice for company.  Love the the singer serve. Nice hot coffee but the next time I went to make a pot the water wouldn't come out.  Lots of sputtering.  This happened with both pots.Only had them a few months each.  Called the company.  They were useless to help me.  The first one I had for about six months.  The second is still less than ninety days so will attempt to take back.  Too bad because a I love the piping hot coffee from the singer serve side.  Too bulky for just that though.

My favorite feature is the temperature settings. If I want my coffee to last longer in the morning - high setting, but if I am more tired than usual, or if I know I wont have long to drink it - low setting. You can start taking big drinks on the low heat setting, but the coffee is still nice and hot. For everything in between you can just keep it on medium. Love this machine!

review text: This machine makes very good espressos and capuccinos. It also seems to offer incredible value ...But here is the catch: the three models I had (including one replacement) failed in exactly the same manner by starting leaking water after about 10 months of use. The first time, I thought I had not cared/cleaned it properly, so I took my loss and bought a new one that I thoroughly cleaned each month. Failed again, exactly the same way. Same for the replacement machine I got under the warranty.I conclude that this is a bad design and a machine to be avoided unless you enjoy buying disposable espresso machines.Now hear this about De Longhi treats its customers: first, to get a replacement under the de Longhi warranty, you will have to pay 35$ (half the price of the machine new, how about that, didn't even know it was legal!). And if your replacement machine happens to also fail like mine did, you're out of luck as the warranty is only for the duration of your ORIGINAL purchase, in other words the replacement machine is not warranted, which I think is SO unfair.BUYER BEWARE. De Longhi makes seemingly attractive products, but the quality is not there and evidently the firm couldn't care less about its customers.

review text: I, like many, got tired of paying the expensive price of K-Cups and wanted a simple one cup brewer.  At first I was reluctant to buy the "The Scoop" due to some of the negative reviews.  But upon further thought, knowing that I can return anything from Amazon, I decided to give it a try.  And I love it.  It makes a great cup of coffee. Not good, great. Better than the Kurig. So, those reviewers that complain the coffee to weak are either not reading the directions, as more coffee is worse and packing the coffee is going to make a weaker cup of coffee.  I am a Starbucks fan, not Dunkin, so I like a deep rich coffee. I used Starbuck Sumatra with a regular grind.  I was using Dark Magic K-cups.  In my opinion the Scoop wins, and with the easy of use and  the price of the device and the cost of making coffee my Keurig is about to go on e Bay.  Anybody want it?

review text: This is a great coffee maker for someone looking to spend under $100. I thoroughly researched coffee makers in this price range and settled on this one despite the negative reviews.1. This maker is easy to use and easy to clean.2. The lid on the thermos is hard to twist if you tighten it too much. Simple solution: don't tighten it that much.3. The carafe is excellent and keeps coffee piping hot for two hours; it is still hot enough to drink without microwaving four hours later.4. The design ensures that the coffee never sees the light of day as it is brewing, so your coffee remains hot.5. I'm not sure what temperature this brews at, but it seems to be hotter than other machines I've tried in the price range.In all, this is a good coffee maker for the price.

review text: We purchased this machine after replacing a 5-year old Krups machine.  Our finicky friends recommended this machine saying it was the best one they've ever had.  I found it cumbersome to operate.  Here's why:1.  Because it is a stainless steel pot, you have to guess how much water you're putting in the carafe.  Once poured into the machine, you can see how much your putting in but may have to go back to get more water.  Wouldn't be a big deal in of itself except for another thing...2.  The lid.  The design is irritating beyond belief.  You twist it on and after brewing have to use a towel to untwist it because it gets vacuum sealed on there practically.  Also, when pouring, you have to untwist it so the "O" is matching the "O" on the spout.  And then it's a slower pour compared to the plain ole pot.3.  The coffee basin lid needs to be snapped into place to create a seal on the aroma. Why not just make a lid that closes and seals without having to push it down and snap it?I'm sure all these things except for the first make it a technically great tasting cup of coffee, but for me, the average Jane, just wanting a quick cup of joe... it's a few too many steps for me to enjoy fully.Maybe I'm just too cranky before I get my first cup?********************** Update 3 years later ***********************Machine is a trooper!  One to two pots a day and I got used to the features after a few weeks.  I have to admit, it makes a flavorful cup o' joe and I always get compliments from family & friends.TIP on CLEANING:  The only way to get the stainless caraf like new is to put a TEASPOON of automatic dishwasher soap and fill the caraf with hot water.  Let it sit a good long while (hour or so) and rinse thoroughly with more hot water.  Sparkles like new!

review text: This espresso machine was a wedding gift and it worked really well for a year and a half and then it just stopped heating water. I called the company and they said that it was not repairable and to toss it out. If it had lasted longer I would have rated it higher. One other issue is that it's not very consistent in the flavor of the espresso. We use the same brand, and sometimes it comes out without a crema.

We think the water is backing up in the reservoir, but we make 2 cups of coffee per day?  What machine can't do this? Long and short of it, decide for yourselves, but we will no longer purchase things like this from Amazon.

review text: I'll start by saying the Keurig B60 makes a phenomenal cup of coffee. Now for the bad news. After having it for a month and a half the three buttons that determine the amount of coffee that is to be dispensed do not work properly.Sometimes they provide the right amount, and sometimes they don't. I should add that I use only spring water,have cleaned the two "needles" that puncture the K-cups and have even cleaned it with vinegar as recommended.For those who are considering buying this product,do a Google search on it and you will see countless numbers of people who have had the problem I am having and ones much worse.

review text: If you don't put the basket in just right (no room for error) you will have a flooded mess of coffee grounds. I am careful and it can still happen. The carafe tends to leak when pouring a cup of coffee. It makes decent coffee and looks nice, but I am looking for a new one that I can rely on. I think it's worth to spend an extra $20 and have a solid coffee maker.

This automatic latte maker is so easy to use that Starbucks is going to loose a lot of my business. You just put a few tablespoons of reg coffee , add water and milk, add your favorite coffee syrup(sold at most grocery stores today, and Target sells Starbucks syrup) it takes about a minute and voila , you have a great latte. I really hope whoever buys this enjoys it as much as I do!!!!!

I don't use the cappacino portion too often, but I like having only one machine on my counter instead of a coffemaker AND a cappacino machine.  This is a very nice product.

review text: Great concept - Terrible execution! Extremely flimsy - I've never seen such a low grade plastic. Be prepared for it to slide all over your counter. Because it's so light weight even when full, you MUST hold it when dispensing. The condensation issue is seriously flawed. Opening the cover results in water everywhere - get the paper towels ready. The idea of no carafe is pretty cool, but keeping old coffee in the internal tank is kinda funky. Because it's got nooks and crannies it's very hard to clean. Even at full capacity it only makes 1.5 good size mugs of coffee. Who uses actual "cup" sized cups anymore? For $5 more I bought the Mr.Coffee with tons of features, one of which was the fact that as soon as the lid is opened ALL the condensation goes directly back into the reservoir without spilling a single drop. It also included a carbon filter, but best of all you can make anywhere between 4 and 12 cups - much more flexibility.Amazon was GREAT as usual, they took it back and issued a refund before I even shipped it back. They should really reconsider offering this model at any price.

review text: I have the EAM3200, which is the previous model version. The differences are slight but noticeable to the newer. These machines are the best in class for price and performance, produce a great espresso, and are maintainable in ways that other manufacturers models are not. The coffee from the Delonghi is just as good as from Jura and even some manual models such as Expobar and Rancillo. It is very close to what you find in Italy - not quite, but for the price it is worth it. Great crema, hot temperature, rich flavor. And the best part is you can pull out the brew mechanism and clean it - VERY key. This will ensure sound operation and function for many years.In order to keep this machine is fine working order, you need to do a bit of upkeep each week and use the right beans.1. Only use non-oily, 100% Arabica beans. If you use oily beans it will clog frequently and attract rancid flavors. It will also shorten the life of the machine. I use Illy, but any espresso will do (I actually get the Illy dark roast - it has more flavor when brewing a larger "americano" cup).2. Clean the brew mechanism once a week. Just snap it out and run it under hot water.3. Use spring water instead of tap water. This will keep any weird flavors from your tap entering the coffee. It may build up minerals, but...4. De-calcify the machine when it asks for it - don't wait.I, for one, would rather have manual controls over coffee amount, strength, etc. You are not losing out on anything by not having digital controls - other than not being able to have the machine automatically on and ready to go when you first wake up. As for the other models ability to do milk-based drinks at the touch of a button - how often do you really want a cappuccino? If it is every day, then get the 3500. If you are like me and need real coffee in the morning, then get this model. The milk canister can only sit in the fridge for so long. If you are planning to serve cappuccino at dinner parties, then you are committing Italian heresy - cappuccino is only served in the morning.CONS1. The cup warmer does not work very well, but get double walled cups and the temperature of the product will not be an issue.2. You can't have it turn on automatically at a certain time. But it only takes a few minutes to get up to temperature.3. It is NOISY.My espresso settings - coffee amount at 10 o'clock, strength at 3 o'clock, single cup dispense. Super double espresso in an espresso cup. I may have 2 of these on a saturday.My wife's "americano" settings - coffee amount at 3 o'clock, strength at 3 o'clock, double cup dispense. Full cup of rich coffee in a normal cup.Bean grind at 5.

review text: I'm quite enjoying my Cuisinart, with only one middling complaint -- it is hard to pour water into it due to the design of the water reservoir, the reservoir lid and the coffee pot itself.  Other than that, it makes great coffee.  Not only that, but it keeps it hot enough for my wife (who prefers her beverages as near the boiling point as possible) for hours after brewing.  It's a nice looking unit as well, although not as large as its imposing pictures make it look.  All in all, a great buy.

review text: I decided to replace my 15 yr old Proctor Silex because I was concerned about 15 yrs of boiling water going over and through it's plastic innards. After much research, I realized that it's impossible to find an automatic drip coffee maker that doesn't contain plastic. I read a bunch of reviews and went with this model based on looks and price. However, this model is even worse than my ancient Proctor Silex--it actually has MORE plastic, which hardly seems possible. Topping it is the plastic pour spout on the carafe to guarantee I get that last dose of endocrine disruptors before I drink my cup o joe. Had I seen this in a store, I'd have passed on this model because of the plethora of plastic. Really, I can't get over the fact that they went to the trouble of putting extra plastic on the tip of the glass carafe. Why???And yes, I know I could use a french press or similar, but in the am I need fast coffee and lots of it! Oh, and it really does take 12 minutes for the brew cycle, and although the description here makes a big deal about it's "brew pause" capability, my instruction manual says NOT to use it. The brew pause is just like my old PS--if you take out the carafe, the water opening closes, although some still drips out. State of the art it is not!It makes a good cup of coffee, but most drip makers do. As other reviewers have pointed out, it has a LOUD irritating alarm. And the alarm goes off even if you are using the regular brew cycle (not the programmed delay).I paid $52 for this and since it'll cost me $10 to return it, I'll keep it. It looks nice and I feel quite posh with my Cuisinart coffee maker on the counter. But really, my $25 Proctor Silex has less plastic and is still going strong after 15 years. Reading these reviews, I'm doubtful the Cuisinart will make it that long. All in all, I would not recommend this maker unless you get it for some wonderful deal.ETA that one month later we've broken the carafe. Totally our fault but I see that it's $20 to replace. I could buy an entire coffee maker for the price. The glass is thin which keeps the coffee hot but also means easy breaks. Really, unless you're big on name brands, pass on this and get a cheaper Mr. Coffee like Consumer Report recommends.EDITED 7/11  The coffee maker just died. Hubs thinks it's a fuse because he saw a spark. We got two years out of this coffee maker. Debating whether to order a fuse and try to figure it out, in the meantime have broken out the now-18 yr old made in America Proctor Silex. Which still works. Thanks for nothing, China!

review text: A nice utilitarian addition to the kitchen. The concept is great, either one cup with traveling mug on one side, can use some pods. A regular carafe on the other side.The operation is easy, when on, the blue light goes on. Very nice. The coffee is hot and one can make it dark with a brew option.The parts as usual look flimsy plastic. I hope they last for some time. A timer is very useful. There are many such nice coffee makers in the market. For around $70, this one with single cup serving appears to be the best.Beware: when ordering. A permanent gold filter can be got for a penny more, if you check the right box. I forgot. Will have to shell out five bucks for a new one. One can of course keep on using regular filter. The single side has a permanent filter which doubles as a scoop. Just started using it, and liking it very much.

review text: This coffee maker makes very good coffee.  The carafe is a perfect size for two large cups coffee.  I would have given it five stars if Mr. Coffee had made the clock more easily visible.  The clock is recessed into the frame and not back-lit making it necessary to tilt the maker backward to allow light to illuminate the display.  While tilting it backward you then use a free thumb and the other hand to advance the time to the time you want it to brew.  If you can handle this it's a good coffee maker.

review text: We have gone through a lot of coffee makers in the past few years.  This time we decided to do some extra homework, and eventually purchased this one.  We are very pleased with the purchase.Pros:- Hot water dispenser (obvious)- Ensures condensation falls back into reservoir- Very easy controls and programming- Alarm when brewing is complete- Notifies you when it needs more water- You can set the temp and length of time to keep the heating plate active for the coffee potCons:- Does not purchase new coffee grounds when we get low- Does not deliver cups to my office (I actually have to walk over to the pot)

review text: We got the coffee pot as a wedding gift eight years ago. We have never had problems with it up until about a week ago. It quit brewing ful pots and would turn off as soon as it was done brewing. Today it won't turn on :(. I read complaints about the water well being too small; was not a problem for us. The electronics, setting the timer and what not was easy enough. All in all I will be purchasing another one of the same.

review text: If you are looking at this product I'm guessing you're like me...trying to save money by making smaller amounts of coffee at a time and totally against the idea of the wasteful expense of a K-cup system. I think it is safe to say this is a great option for you.The product makes a good cup of coffee. It's only real flaw is the water only gets "adequately" hot, rather than piping hot. I found that running my cup under hot water for a few seconds before brewing greatly helps that, and if you are drinking the coffee immediately after brewing it is really not an issue. Compared to a K-cup unit, I think it's actually a more drinkable immediately.Using this unit should save you a lot of money on coffee. I also have a typical ten-cup coffee maker, which uses ten full teaspoons for one pot of coffee, giving me 4-5 actual mugs of coffee (two of which usually get wasted). With this unit, I use 2.5 teaspoons of coffee to make about a mug and a half of coffee, none of which gets wasted. Plus I have found that immediately refilling the water and running it again with the same grounds works great. So call it 3 mugs of coffee with only 2.5 small scoops of grounds and no waste. My regular coffee purchases have decreased dramatically since buying this unit.Overall the coffee is flavorful and not weak as long as you use the "bold" setting. Is a much bolder and smoother brew than your basic Keurig cup. I use a My K-Cup in a standard Keurig machine at the office, and I like the Hamilton Beach unit's coffee much better.Many reviews here have complained about splattering or messy grounds...all I can say is your mileage may vary and you have to experiment a little for example I found that grocery store bought bags of Seattle's Best work great in this unit, however Gevalia Grounds are too fine and tend to make a mess. Regardless the unit is really easy to clean.

If I make 8 cups, it leaks at least a cup or two on to the counter.Edit 1/8/13:Increasing to 3 stars from one star.  Spoke with Melitta customer service.

review text: I worked at S-Bucks back in the day of a hand pulled shot. Their new electronic machines just don't cut it. This machine replicates that hand-pulled taste I've longed for. I owned an expensive S-Bucks machine and hated it. This machine pulls perfect shots with beautiful and tasty crema!! It froths milk easily, only room for improvement is if the steam wand could pull out in other positions but I'll live with it. Make sure to buy a PUMP driven machine if you want AUTHENTIC espresso, the others won't cut it! I'd recommended this as the perfect gift or addition to your home. You will be pleased. (Make sure to follow the step by step guide until you have it down and MAKE SURE to prime the pump!!)

review text: I bought this since my drip coffee maker died. I've only had it for a few weeks but have been making a pot of coffee with it everyday. Very easy to learn to use and the coffee tastes much better than my old drip coffee. I love that it stays hot all day, I can have the same hot coffee at night as I did in the morning. No burnt or bitter taste. I find I can use less sugar or cream since the coffee tastes so much better from this!I'm using my #4 cone filters up with it by tearing a small hole to put through the tube and just folding it down to fit in the basket. I seen a local store does have round filters so I will get them when I finish up my other ones. While some grinds will get to the bottom and might find themselves in my last cup of coffee, as I get better with fitting the filter in I get less or no grinds in my coffee.Hope it lasts for years to come and I'm one of those people who are still using theirs after 10 years ;)

review text: I have trusted Melita.  I had this coffee maker for 4 months. It makes good coffee -- I especially liked the "robust" feature that strengthens the coffee while brewing (brews slower though).My complaints are similar to other reviewers:  the carafe is soooooo leaky -- every time you pour, whether into the water reservoir, or into a cup, the liquid runs down the side.  Originally I thought, no big deal.  Except it became a big deal when I kept pouring coffee on the counter, which ran under the coffee maker, or when it splashed it on me.  I kept a towel next to the pot; tried to pour using the towel as a drip rag.  Semi successful, but a pain.Then there is the carafe breakage issue -- just as others said, the glass is so thin, remarkably so for a coffee carafe.  And like others, it took nothing at all to break it.  I simply set it down on the counter -- I did not drop it, throw it or slam it.  I just sat it down on the counter.  I've never had any other type of beverage holder breaks so easily.So I enjoyed delicious, robust but rather messy coffee for four months.  Then the whole thing went into the garbage.  Very disappointed that Melita put out such a substandard product.

review text: I cannot believe that people have problems with this:a) it is only supposed to pull 1 or 2 oz, any more would be weak. This is normal.b) use a 10 or 12 oz frothing pitcher and swing the arm out to the side like you're supposed to. You CAN froth milk nicely. It takes practice and I'm still perfecting it.c) If you are not able to fit 2 full scoops in then I'm not sure what you're doing wrong. I am grinding my espresso using the fine setting on my Capresso Infinity burr grinder and it will fit two FULL scoops into the larger filter. You should be adding a little at a time then banging lightly on the counter to settle it, then add more. At the end, lightly tamp before pulling the shot.d) The espresso is plenty dark. If yours isn't try a different grind. I can pull a 25-30 second shot with this using Gimme coffee's "Leftist" from the fourth fine setting on my Capresso Infinity. It is an excellent shot. On par with those Gimme pulls themselves, and also any bit as good as one from Berkeley's Illy cafe or Yali's. If you're using E.S.E. I feel bad for you. Save your money and buy yourself a Mr. Coffee machine. If you have a true love for espresso you'll take the extra two minutes to grind your beans immediately before brewing!Overall: This is an EXCELLENT machine for the cost. I returned a Gaggia machine and am more pleased with this one. It is compact, does exactly what it is supposed to, and it is paying for itself every day. If you buy this a good item to pair it with would be a quality burr grinder such as the Capresso Infinity. I can vouch that the pair make espresso of the utmost quality.Cheers!

review text: I needed a replacement for my Mr Coffee that failed (could not read the LED clock).  I have the Cuisinart bean grinder so this where I started.  I keyed in on this one and the 14 cup model.  Everything works as advertised with a few minor exceptions-  When you open the lid to remove yesterdays grounds, the water condensation will pour off the lid onto your counter, also adding the water can be interesting if you use the carafe,  it's a dribbler.  I use a separate pitcher - problem solved.To wrap things up -I've had this model about 4 months and it is churning out fresh coffee on a daily basis without fail.  Amazon had the best price although the shipping cost canceled out the mail in rebate. (Which the local sales tax and gas cost would have also canceled out the rebate).  I can recommend this brand/model.

It was the cheapest pump-driven machine I found.  2.) It is smart looking and doesn't take up much space.  3.) It has more plastic parts than I prefer, but it is light weight, which I like.  I use the machine daily; it has been trouble free.  I recommend it without hesitation,

review text: For half the money you get a better Mr. Coffee. Here are the problems with this one:a) Coffee taste the same or lower than Mr. Coffee's thermal carafe machine.b) If you remove the carafe on this one, it always drips - always. You'll hear and see the drops and you will have to clean them.c) It brews "too fast" - and then the coffee keeps being heated, until it starts having a burned taste. You have to serve it fast or use a thermos.d) Strange taste from the charcoal filter - I had to remove it and clean the machine with vinegar twice (it had bad taste when it arrived, and the filter made it worse).e) You will probably spill a lot of water while trying to fill the water tank - the opening is narrow. It'll probably spill on cables or wall plugs - that's because the power cable of this machine is very short, which means it will be really close to the wall plug. A bit hazardous.It looks high tech but the coffee doesn't taste well, the filter drips when you remove the carafe, the carafe will spill most of the time while serving, the power cord is too short which means that spilling water while trying to fill the narrow opening of the water tank will make it hazardous.

I read lots and lots of reviews of the different brands and settled on this one.  For the most part, I love it....The Good:  **I love the program feature--coffee is all made when I wake up.  **I also love the "brew strength" setting.  I like very strong coffee, so this is a great feature.  **The carafe keeps the coffee warm for hours (but if you like is scalding hot, it never reaches that temp, even at the start).  **I have not had any overflow problems that a lot of the other brands seem to have.  Easy to use, right from the start.Could Be Better:  The only real drawback I can see to this pot is the temperature. I don't mind my coffee not being scalding hot, but since I had been making my coffee with boiling water, I was used to it a little warmer.  If you like your coffee extra hot, you won't get it that way with this pot.  I does come out at a nice drinking temperature right away though, and like I said earlier, the carafe keeps it warm (not hot) for hours.Overall, I am very satisfied, and would recommend this product to others.

review text: Had maker for approx 1 month and auto shut down started acting up.  Have it's set for 4 hour time and started shutting off immediately after done brewing. What's the point of having a timer if it shuts off directly after brewing.

review text: Makes good coffee.  That's all that counts.  THe fact that the water reservoir and the coffee grounds/filter are separate compartments ensures no cross contamination - which is one reason I picked this unit in the first place.

review text: I like the idea, but have found that the coffee is not hot enough if you use creamer. The heating source is loud if you try to keep the unit on after it has finished brewing. Not happy with this item at all.

review text: Well when the product finally showed up after XMAS. Thanks Amazon.The product was a gift. But I set it up. The water heated very fast, it holds a large capacity of storage water, its filtered. What more could you asked for... Oh I know cheaper filters. $30 for 4 really?

review text: We're Cuisinart fans (still are) and bought this because we figured if it's Cusinart, it's gotta be good.  Big mistake.  I just walked over and threw away this awful product and I wouldn't give this to my worst enemy.  Don't be a sucker and buy this contraption.  The idea is alluring - just put in the whole beans, add water, press a button and voila.  Think about the typical coffee maker where you have a separate grinder and you put the ground coffee in the basket, add water and you're done.  How often have you had to "wash" your grinder? Less than one time I'm guessing?  Maybe wipe it with a paper towel from time to time?  With this P.O.S. the grinder is coated with moist grounds so you have take apart the two-part contraption and wash it and there are plenty of nooks and crannies to clean...you have to do this each time you use the machine.About a third of the time that you use the machine, you'll have a flood.There's a design flaw when you pour in the water, some it flies out the back of one of the vent holes and onto the floor so you have to tilt the machine forward with one hand while adding water with the other.Regardless of the bean/water ratio, the coffee is weak.Thermal carafes are fine but the coffee has to be hot from the get-go.  Brewed coffee with the Grind-and-Brew is lukewarm and this is a problem because there's no warmer - it's a thermal carafe so my first cup is not quite hot enough and I have to nuke it.Taking into consideration clean-up, it takes far less time to use a much less expensive standard coffee maker with a separate grinder and you'll get a dramatically superior cup of coffee with far less hassle.THIS IS AN AWFUL PRODUCT - DON'T BUY IT.

review text: Pros: Have enjoyed this coffee maker from the first day. We looked at many different Carafe models but could not find one as nice as this. Coffee stays fresh and hot in the Carafe. No hot plate needed with carafe style maker to keep the coffee warm.Cons: Carafe lid top could be made better as it is sometimes hard to grip to open.
