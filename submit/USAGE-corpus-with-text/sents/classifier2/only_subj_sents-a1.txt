It just want he wanted.We would both recommend it to others.
Otherwise, I would high recommend it.
very pleased
:)
In the Aye of  A Storm
You really can't go wrong with this, and the people who complain "you have to turn the knob to 'brew' AND THEN hit the 'on' switch!"
Slightly disappointing
It was fine until it caught fire this morning
Beware.
meh
just frustrated, really.
there must be something better out there.
Pleased so far
If that's the only thing --- I'm good.
Too bulky for just that though.
Received exactly what was ordered.
Failed again, exactly the same way.
And I love it.
Not good, great.
Simple solution: don't tighten it that much.3.
Very quick - would highly recommend it.
Wouldn't be a big deal in of itself except for another thing...2.
Pretty good but...
I received it in a short time and am enjoying it daily.
Leaks,Leaks,Leaks!
Now for the bad news.
Be Careful
I really hope whoever buys this enjoys it as much as I do!!!!
I would highly recommend it.
thanks.
All in all, a great buy.
Compact, lightweight.
I've been using it twice a day for months now, and I'm still happy with it.
But really, this is my only complaint and the reason for four instead of five stars.
Which still works.
Very nice.
I hope they last for some time.
Just started using it, and liking it very much.
Perfect
A simple Suggestion
We have never had problems with it up until about a week ago.
Today it won't turn on :(.
All in all I will be purchasing another one of the same.
You will be pleased.
Amazing!!!
Enjoy!
Leaked and splattered
And like others, it took nothing at all to break it.
Holding up just fine.
YUMMMMMMMOOOOOOO
This was a gift and it is used nearly everyday!
Get a cheaper one
**I have not had any overflow problems that a lot of the other brands seem to have.
Defective
disappointed
Awsome
Big mistake.
Wish I had read other reviews
Looking forward to many happy days of cooking with these in years to come.
Awesome Gift
No good!!
Overall I would not recommend buying these.
Beware...
This is not going to work for my light appetizer reception.
I will be returning.
That way I don't have to keep the old unmatched stuff.
I really don't think you'll go wrong with this product.
A Cut Above
I am a hobby kitchen dude and for the casual kitchen dweller you have found what you are looking for.
great and sturdy
They are wonderful.
=) will purchase again in the future if I have too
Junk.
This is not what I received
I've been hand washing them and haven't had any problems so far.
I'm really glad I did.
So damn funny.
Not what I was hoping for!
:-(
You get what you pay for
It is unbeleivably HORRIBLE!
Great
The biggest problem is that I bought them about a year and a half ago and they pretty much started rusting immediately.
Awsome!
Sharp!
Not me.
Nope.
Two days of sitting in the sink with other dirty dishes (don't judge)they had already rusted.
I am not even kidding you.
These are going back.
Not as impressed as others .... returned
I would definitely recommend these to anyone.
Will reccommend to others.
Win win for me.
Almost perfect
Despite this pain in the a**, I would recommend.
dont buy.
Super!
Great buy.
Highly recommend!
Powerful and elegant!
I would buy another one.
Highly recommend!
Perfect for my needs
I only wish it were a little more powerful.
I have not had any issues with it and probably have used it almost every day for the past few weeks I've had it.
When she opened her gift I heard things like "Wow, that is huge."
and "I'm not sure that is going to fit."
Better than expected!
I highly recommend it!
Buy This!
Spacious and smart!
At first things were going well...but just as my father always taught me...you get what you pay for, son.
It barely made it 4 months.
I learned my lesson.
Very positively impressed! Five-Star-Rating called for!
Five-Star-Rating called for!
Excellent.
So happy I purchased it.
This one replaced it and it was just what we were looking for.
GARBAGE!
What a piece of CRAP.
Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS!
Good bang for the buck.
Unbelievable.
Dead after 4 months
Really weird.
No issues so far.
My family loves it.
I would recommend it to anyone who needs a new microwave.
Nice!
expensive piece of junk
No complaints.
Only had it a month, but so far no problems.
Two problems in as many months
Maybe I just got a lemon.
Very disappointing!
You get what you pay for!
It gives the impression that it's probably going to last forever.
AWESOME.
Dead after 10 months
They don't work either.Update:  I may have spoken a little hastily.
I can live with that.
Even the best products break down sometimes.
Sufficient
They are in fact a "fulfillment center."
Unevan Cooking and Loud
You can prepare 2 exact meals and one will come out over cooked, and the other one will come back lukewarm.
Reliable
It dies on me after many years.
Very loud.
Hard to figure out.
Quick and easy use.
Needs a better light.
Well, as easy as it can be with an office of messy ba_tards that don't clean up after themselves.
I am very concerned.
"We do apologize for the inconvenience.
WAY-TOO-NOISY (+_+)!
NICE!
more than i bargained for
Just what I needed!
I have had it for a couple of weeks now and have not run across any issues.
Thanks!
A Little Disappointing
Well, you get what you pay for.
Right now my wife and I are very pleased
I don't know what went wrong
Would recommend!
Only had it for a few weeks and have no complaints so far.
Once it starts getting a little brown, it goes very fast.A couple of other complaints I have:1.
Except for toasting bread.
Just what I needed.
It is perfect!
It has paid for itself in the two months I have owned it.
Bought 6 months ago and so far no problems.
Burn hazard !!!!
Love
Recommend
Thought spending twice as much would do the trick.
It's going back.
Did realize that was asking so much!
It does the job.
Feh!
Hot Damn, This Shit Makes My Morning
If I butter it right away, it's not a big deal.
Reasonably priced2.
That's where things went down hill pretty quickly.
I sure wish everything could be that simple.
What a pain compared to this product.
This was a gift and they are still thanking me
Highly recommended
Nice but not perfect.... nevermind
It  worth what we paid for it.
Would not recommend
The only thing...
Somewhat Disappointed
Lots of fun.
Which was all we wanted in the first place.Also it's very pretty.
As for the most important part?
Okay
Convenient and delicious start to the day
If it were to break tomorrow, I'd just buy another.
I'm truly surprised someone would manufacture something so utterly useless.
Pathetic.
Very nice so far
Would recommend!!
Strangely uneven and quick to break but . . .
NOT GOOD ENOUGH!
Great
Great idea, but it burns everything
No response.
Tried again a week later...  again no response.
A minor issue in an otherwise great device.
It's OK, or good enough, but nothing to write home about.
Dissapointed
not properly alligned.
I would recommend to anyone !
Extremely Disappointed
Great
And until we have at least $100 in the budget for a new toaster, we've stopped looking and will keep this little gem.
I would give this about 2.5 stars.
Sturdy and small.
Convenient
And beautiful.
Great Deal!!!!
Wonderful
Attractive and Functional
Yes it is expensive, but so worth it to me!
They fit nicely and you can fill them completely.
Everyone else here seems to love it.
We have had no issues with it.
Very happy with it.
A friend was having the save problem, so I bought him one and it solved his problem too.
We'd recommend it highly.
Nice
Would highly recommend.
I may return this after this week.
be persistent worth buying!
I let it stand overnight to see if it'd help, with maybe a slight improvement.
Would recommend.
YES. BUY IT IF YOU WANT/NEED IT.
SMALL, SMALL, SMALL
Flawless
Lots of compliments.
Great Fit
I love it.
Would buy more.
As a fan would definitely recommend.
Better than expected
So far this has been great.
Junk
What a load of trash.
Great idea, too bad it did not function as expected.
It's really a waste of money.
It has become quite the conversation piece when company is over.
Best investment yet.. I couldn't be happier
I would most definitely recommend this to anyone.
But I just consider that a bonus anyway!
Only problem when you walk too close to it, it will open!
Perfect!
Disappointing
Cheap, and a waste.
It seems like a little ghost kid is messing with it.
I am very disappointed.
Save your money don't get this.
LOVED... for about a month. Very quickly became extremely annoying!
Initially, I was slightly shocked, but then began to laugh very hard.
!My recommendation- PASS ON THESE, THEY'RE A BIGGER HEADACHE THEN THEY'RE WORTH!
Perfect.
They are large enough for this type of moderate use, yet not too big.
Just What I've Always Needed
Really great product
but i didn't get what i expected.
I love it.
If I had any complaint, it would be that it does not come out quite far enough.
overall a pleasure.
can't be beat
Not useful
Highly recommendable....
Sturdy
I love it!!
If you are thinking about purchasing it, DON'T WAIT!
I bought two!
So farso good
Great!
Then it would be perfect!
We bought 2, one for the living room and one for our bedroom.
This is a must-have for any new mom who doesn't want their entire house smelling like baby poo.
Great so far.
We have not had any critters manage to get in it yet.
Average
Excellent
I returned for refund.
New incentive!
Good enough
There are no dents.
I've had this about six months and not one major issue.
Excellent
I'm very impressed.
Thanks.
I'm in love...
Within 2 months of light use, I fell victim to the 'no suction' syndrome.
Either way, this may not be your solution, but it did fix the issue I was having in one minute.
Highly recommend it.
not what i thought.
Does exactly what I want it to do!
That's really a very small quibble.
I read one that said it was difficult to manuver.
Thanx, Hoover!
Bought this one a few weeks ago and so far, so good.
Love this product!
I'm like a 5 year old with a new fave toy!!
:)
Doesn't work...don't buy
Thank goodness, because wehave a new puppy.
amazed!
It is a bit noisy, but Im cleaning not trying to watch tv or listen to music, just trying to get it done as quickly and efficiently as possible.
sucks
C'mon!
great for what it is!
WOW.
but overall i would say it is worth the money.
This one's a keeper.
Out of the box reactions:-It's SMALL!!
Love love love
All I know is that it was a huge pain to us.
I'm not sure what the problem is, but it's not worth it to us to fix it seeing as we were frustrated with it to begin with.
buy this one.
But for the month I've had it, I have been very impressed.
Badly.
If you don't get it perfictly centered and balanced, it will take a dive and could break something.
Underpowered
This is just about the handiest thing to happen since sliced bread!
I am so far beyond thrilled, there's not even a word for it.
I can't recommend this beauty enough!
being so great is a FRAUD ON THE WORLD.
ok.
Fabulous!
Then I bought this little charmer.
Will Pay for Itself
Fantastic!
I have been using this for 2 weeks and it really does a great job!
You get what you pay for so please keep that in mind.
:-)
If I knew it I would have not bought it.
But here is a headsup.
Any other people having this problem?
Perfect for new baby..
I absolutely love it.
The only problem I have with it is my fault.
But it is better than you would expect.
I still am waiting to buy the dryer.
Sorry but...didn't like it at all
Being a woman and generally nervous about plumbing matters, I always expect frustration, rage and tears when I have to deal with a new plumbing situation.
I recommend it highly!
single mom's best friend
A wonderful Gift
Wish we had found it sooner!
I wish I had bought this years ago.
Don't think about this one....just buy it...You will be glad you did!
Does a good job.
Thinking about getting one for my mom
Absolutly everything I expected.
I've been using Arm & Hammer liquid with the softener in it and have had no over-sudsing issues.
I think I was getting depression from having to drag my laundry out and up and down my stairs to the 2nd floor, especially during WNY winter, and now I'm SAVED!!
So, Love, Love, Love!!
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
Lesson learned!
very useful
Gift From the Heavens!!!
We were happy so far....
Don't Think About It...Just Buy It!!
I took them out and was pleased to see that they were back to their normal self.
I feel like I get a little workout from it too.
So glad I found this......
:)
How did I live without it??
I'm not sure why other people complained of it's capacity or this noise problem as we have neither.
Perfect Alternative
Wish I had bought one ages ago
So far, so good!
I can highly recommend it to my friends.
You get what you pay for.
It actually holds MORE then we thought it would!
Excellent For What You Get
It is very versatile .
Very convenient
), they are still "reviewing" our case!
If and when I need a dryer - I will buy the matching dryer.I call it the 'little engine that could'.
broken from the get go
pristine.
While it's not perfect, it doesn't claim to be either.
