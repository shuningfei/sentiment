The cup warmer does not work very well, but get double walled cups and the temperature of the product will not be an issue.2.
These knives cut okay, not great, but okay.
Typical microwave
Huge Microwave
It is sized and looks similar to a 13 inch CRT television set.
Microwave is okay.
It is also lighter.I like that this toaster has a button to push to eject the bread versus turning a dial like on other brands.I would like to see a redesign of the top to make it easier to wipe crumbs away.
I've toasted buns and it works out OK.I'm satisfied.
I kind of think i should have bought the larger model, because there have been a couple time that i have had a guest over and it would have been nice to get both eggs done in one shot.
Maybe in time, I will get used to the new dial option.This toaster over gets three stars.
In my opinion, a poor design.In summation: an OK toaster oven, it functions, but nothing special.
Batteries not included.
trash can does its job, but nothing more.
This thing is also nice for cleaning under tables and areas where I would have normally pulled out attachments or moved furniture, with the crevice tool and hose, I see my life getting loads easier.For the price, I would have totally been okay using this as a 'stair vacuum' only.
Keep in mind that I have owned over 50 vacuums in past 10 years.Like most Bissells, the Cleanveiw has a very aggressive brush roll.
Not exactly a "wonder" but works ok for diapers
The wonderwash works ok for the diapers, however I rinse them myself by hand.
