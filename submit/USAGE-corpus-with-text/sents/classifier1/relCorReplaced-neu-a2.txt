My carafe does leak when I pour the water in but frankly, I have never had one that did not leak.
You know, I was getting a little nuts reading the schizophrenic yet passionate reviews for the DCC-1200.
The differences are slight but noticeable to the newer.
The glass is thin which keeps the coffee hot but also means easy breaks.
I did found the top of the carafe a little difficult to remove and replace until I got familiar with using it.
These knives cut okay, not great, but okay.
Typical microwave
Microwave is okay.
As one other reviewer noted, english muffins don't fare very well in this device, but they don't get mangled in ours; just a little curved.
The only thing I don't really care for is the size of this toaster.
toaster seemed to be it!
Maybe in time, I will get used to the new dial option.This toaster over gets three stars.
In my opinion, a poor design.In summation: an OK toaster oven, it functions, but nothing special.
I would give this about 2.5 stars.
only down side is getting fingerprints on it, but it is not a big deal.
I've been using this trash can for 5 months now - it performs flawlessly!A nice sleek look in the kitchen, easy (and amusing) for kids.It does seem to "like" my black bath robe, if I walk by wearing it, the trash can opens, but its not a big deal!
For the price of this product I would say it is just, ok.
This might be a nice vacuum for someone living alone with very light vacuuming to do.
capacity, holds about 1/2 load of a regular sized drum.
Not exactly a "wonder" but works ok for diapers
The wonderwash works ok for the diapers, however I rinse them myself by hand.
