Finally,the PERFECT trash can-in every model,in every way !!!	positive	PERFECT	trash can
I first purchased the 8 gallon plastic model and it was amazing in every way.Never again would I have trouble wiping off a dinner plate or drippy leftovers having to somehow manipulate the poorly designed (but good effort) lids on every trash can ever made.No foot pedal to jerk around with,no more ugly bag hanging over,just move over the perfectly measured and designed lid and voila,the best part of the meal is here!	positive	best part	meal
Yes,that's how beautiful this invention is and works.So I decided to pass this model on to my mom and go for the 13 gallon stainless steel model.While the lid is slightly smaller than the plastic model,on account of the sleek "wall hugger space saver"design,which required a little better aim til I got used to it,I was even more pleased with the beauty of the unit and overall I was happy with my decision.But don't get me wrong, the 8 gallon plastic model works just as well and is a sharp little trashcan,as far as trash cans go.Both trashcans are lightning fast.As fast as you can put your hand in front of the lid,bang,it pops right up.It stays up til you're done,move away and boom,it pops down.It's quiet enough.Nice little whirling sound.It has an on/off button on the back,in case kids wanna play around with it,or around it.	positive	Nice	little whirling sound
Worse comes to worse you can take out the 6 "D"batteries that should last for years if the kiddies figure out the on/off button.But that's unlikely.It has a "stay open" button as well,for those busy occassions.AND, they both stay as clean as you choose to keep them because it's so easy to "hit the mark" every time!	positive	so easy	hit the mark
It has a "ring",which tightly and neatly holds down any type of bag and hides the overlap very cleverly so it doesn't get soiled( BE CAREFUL NOT TO FORGET TO REMOVE THE RING WHEN CLOSING THE FULL BAG, OR OUT WITH THE BAG TO THE STREET IT WILL GO!!!).	positive	very cleverly	overlap
Just a wipe on the top now and then for dust.The design allows you to make the most of each and every garbage bag.No more half full ,wasted bags.Every inch of the bag is used and when it's ready to go there's just the right amount of overhang to close it up.	positive	No more half full ,wasted	bags
AMAZING!EVERY household should have one of these.It is truly a thing of the future, here TODAY!	positive	should have one	EVERY household
Great step can	positive	Great	step can

Frustrated cause I can't return it now... a total loss.	negative	can't return	it
I decided to try this because our previous sensor trashcan stopped working and this seemed to get good reviews.It generally works as described - the main annoying thing (which gives my wife ammo to go back to regular trashcan) is it appears to have a 15-20 second after use pause so if you put something in, and immediately want to throw something else away, you either have to wait what seems like forever, or open it by hand.my previous sensor can would immediately open again if I went to it again - within 1-3 seconds.	negative	immediately open again	previous sensor can

This product is so disappointing, for two reasons.	negative	so disappointing	product
First, within an hour of using it, I somehow ended up with a crease right down the middle of the lid.	negative	crease	middle of the lid
This introduces the second issue - the lid does not completely close.	negative	does not completely close	lid
I wanted a hands-free trash container that would close after I threw something away, but I have to either close it manually, or wedge my toe under the pedal to get the lid the close.	negative	have to either close it manually	hands-free trash container

You have to manually push the "open" or "close" button to get the lid to do what you want it to do.	negative	have to manually push	"open" or "close" button
I also was sick of my old trash cans and thought garbage cans were a nifty idea.	positive	nifty idea	these

HOWEVER... the sensor is WAY OVERLY SENSITIVE!!!	negative	WAY OVERLY SENSITIVE	sensor

It got to the point where I had to cover the sensor with a towel, and sometimes that did not even stop the incessant open and closing of the lid!	negative	did not even stop	towel
This can comes with a ring that hides the trash bag to make it look neater.	positive	neater	look
The problem, is that this ring is smaller in circumstance then the base of the trash can.	negative	smaller	ring
In other words, the whole ring must be disassembled every time you take the trash out, and then reassembled every time the new liner goes in.	negative	must be disassembled	whole ring
That alone added 10 more minuets to taking out the trash.In conclusion, after about 6 months of living with these over sensitive, quite annoying trash cans- I felt I couldn't take it anymore!	negative	quite annoying	trash cans

The $200 price tag for a comparable product from SimpleHuman was too much for me to stomach.	positive	too much for me	comparable product from SimpleHuman
This one is way better: it was less than half the price and I think the compartments are actually slightly larger.	positive	slightly larger	compartments

I could foresee a slight inconvenience trying to clean the nine stars product, but I don't overstuff my trash bags and so I don't need to clean out my waste bin that often.I have no complaints about the sensor (see other reviews - seems to be a persistent issue), but I've had the product for only about a month and a half.	positive	no complaints	sensor
Great in theory, annoying in practice	negative	annoying	practice
We thought this would be a great product, but the infrared sensor can't distinguish between a pair of hands with trash for the bin from somebody walking by the can.	negative	can't distinguish	infrared sensor
As a result, we were constantly setting the thing off inadvertantly, and the sound of the lid going up got to be a bit of a joke.	negative	a bit of a joke	lid
Sometimes it would raise the lid for no apparent reason.	negative	raise the lid for no apparent reason	lid
Sometimes it refused to open, so we had to pause with the trash in hand, until it decided to oblige us.	negative	refused	open
Or worse, when we had several small handfuls to deposit into the bin, it would close right before we tossed the next load in, necessitating a time-consuming cleanup.Eventually we turned off the bloody infrared sensor, and now manually raise and close the lid.	negative	bloody	infrared sensor
I'd like to return it, but the dents I put in the side from kicking the thing when it refused to cooperate kind of makes that an unlikely scenario.	negative	kicking the thing	dents
Until they allow the user to adjust the sensitivity of the sensor, or make one that is psychically connected with the user, save yourself the frustration and go with one of the pedal cans.	negative	go with one	pedal cans

If you have a cabinet with a drawer above it (as most kitched cabinets do), when you pull it out to take out the barrel (ie to change the bag) it does not lift out without some strange angles to clear the drawer face above.	negative	does not lift out without some strange	angles

My only complaint is that although the recommended size K, Simplehuman trash bags fit snugly around the can, they are much longer than needed.	negative	much longer than needed	Simplehuman trash bags
When the can is full of trash and I remove the bag, the bag is only a little less than 3/4's full.	negative	little less than 3/4's full	bag

Excellent Small Trash Can for the Bathroom	positive	Excellent	Small Trash Can
I chose this can only because it was the smallest white can with stainless, but it exceded my expectations.It was my plan to put this between the toilet and sink vanity(a tight fit), however, I didn't take into account for the can lid and toilet tank, so now whenever I push step to open it, the lid will clink the toilet tank.	positive	exceded my expectations	can
I was debating about returning it and ordering a can without a lid, but we decided that we really this can.I honestly was suprised at how perfect this can looked, and is constructed... Now it just needs a few knicks or scratches so it will match the rest of the house!UPDATE: I noticed a few reviewers are worried that the can may be break because of a plastic piece, even though I didn't see anybody actually SAY that it DID break...	positive	perfect	constructed
The can is covered by a TEN YEAR WARRANTY from Simplehuman.	positive	TEN YEAR WARRANTY	can

Perfect Trash Can (two months and counting)	positive	Perfect	Trash Can
The iTouchless (13 gallon) solved those problems for us, and after two months we think it's the perfect trash can.Before we purchased the iTouchless we read a few reviews.	positive	perfect	trash can
My wife was concerned that the can itself would be too weak, since one of the reviews said it dents easily.	positive	was concerned that the can itself would be too weak	can
I don't know what that reviewer was doing with his/her can, but it is definitely strong enough (i.e., as strong as any other metal trash can in the price range) and unless you are throwing rocks at it, I can't see how it would get dented.	positive	as strong	any other metal trash can
We have had absolutely no problems with lid; the two buttons make it easy to keep open when you need, and if you're not using it you can turn it off in the back, which is also very accessible.As for the reviews that mention the plastic cracking, I have not seen any cracks on the plastic rim.	positive	have not seen any cracks	plastic rim
It is pretty solid plastic, so unless you are trying to bend it when pulling the trash bags out, I can't see how it would crack and break.	positive	pretty solid	plastic
So to find a trash can at this price which works this well is really a good deal.	positive	well	works
Very nice product, highly recommend it to others.	positive	Very nice	product

I'm not a fan of spending too much for a trash can, but this was the only one at the store that fit but was still large enough to hold sufficient amount of trash, had hands-free operation, and was stainless steel.	positive	hold sufficient	amount of trash
I can't smell any trash when the can is closed.	positive	can't smell	trash
My pets can smell trash through the can though, so I guess it's not smell-proof.	negative	not smell-proof	can
