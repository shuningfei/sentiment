1200	B006REPXKA	R2GDFD1IMRQSCX	Hamilton Beach Classic Chrome 4 Slice Toaster	Great Toaster!	Looked for a long time before I decided on the Hamilton Beach Classic Chrome 4-Slice Toaster, since it was so reasonably priced.  Furthermore, I have never been disappointed in buying other Hamilton Beach products.  This toaster is very stylish, looks great in our kitchen and is extremely easy to use. Only had it for a few weeks and have no complaints so far.
1201	B004JMZGM2	R2F4BN7PQZREXR	Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler	Our First Toaster Oven	Even tho we have been married for 44 years, this is the first toaster oven we have ever owned.  I have nothing to compare it to, so I will just tell you our experience with it.First of all, it bakes very well.  Frozen french fries, tater tots, chicken breasts, etc.  Its too small to bake a layer cake, but I imagine cookies or cinnamon rolls would do very well in it.It works fairly well for toasting hamburger, hot dog, and hoagy buns when using the bagel mode.  But for toasting bread, just use your pop up toaster. Toasting bread is a little frustrating, because the darkness control is so sensitive. An eighth of an inch left or right is the difference between burnt toast and just warm bread.  It has a beeper for the toasting and bagel function, just lets you know your toast is burnt. Or not done.  You can do it if you stand there and watch it tho.  Once it starts getting a little brown, it goes very fast.A couple of other complaints I have:1.  You really need a flashlight to see if your items are done.2.  A replacement pan costs $20.00 (plus shipping) and is only available from Cuisinart.  All the other replacement pans I could find on the internet were much smaller than the 10" x 11" pan that this one uses.Things I like:1.  It is large enough to make 2 servings of fries or tater tots. Just enough for us.2.  You can do 3 large skinless boneless chicken breasts and use the grilling rack for even cooking on both sides.3.  It preheats quickly and baking is pretty much the same time and temperature as our big oven. Maybe just a little slower.4.  It doesn't heat up the entire kitchen.5.  The pan seems to be fairly non-stick and easy to clean up.  (Cover with foil for the chicken).6.  Its much better for reheating pizza than a microwave. No soggy crust.Bottom line is....I like it and would recommend it. Except for toasting bread.
1202	B0000A1ZN1	R10SNU5AG69BZ	Cuisinart CPT-180 Metal Classic 4-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless	Pray your toaster never fails	We had our toaster about a year and a half when it failed. The right slots {on inner wires}stopped working. I called cuisinart and they sent a new one. Told me I would have to pay to ship new one plus pay to send broken one to them. They finally said they would waive the charge to send new one. I still had to pay to send the broken one. The wrong color was sent{never asked me which one I had}Another phone call- sent ups to get the one that was sent to me. At least 10 days later- another phone- I got my new one yesterday Dec.14. My first call to them was Nov. 18 I sent the broken one back today. It cost me $14.15! Not good customer service.
1203	B004JMZGM2	R29FXMWUKJDCOG	Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler	Just what I needed.	My husband died recently and adjusting to cooking for one has been difficult.  I purchased this toaster oven in hopes of making cooking a little easier and cutting down on my electric bill because I'm not using my oven.  It is perfect!  My electric bill has been lowered significantly.  It has paid for itself in the two months I have owned it.
1204	B000A1FFZE	RT9YIP08KIC95	Hamilton Beach 22708 Toastation 2-Slice Toaster and Mini Oven, Black	Nice for the price	We've had this toaster oven for a few months and we like it. As one other reviewer noted, english muffins don't fare very well in this device, but they don't get mangled in ours; just a little curved. It's not the easiest to clean, either. But the oven works great, bagels brown beautifully and plain bread does well. And it looks really cool.
1205	B009GQ034C	R3OM6EL96363YA	Cuisinart CPT-122 Compact 2-Slice Toaster	consistent toast	Bought 6 months ago and so far no problems. The browning dial works consistently well. I toast 12-grain bread at the 3-4 position, which leaves the bread light brown. This toaster works faster than my previous toaster that we had for 25+ years. It is also lighter.I like that this toaster has a button to push to eject the bread versus turning a dial like on other brands.I would like to see a redesign of the top to make it easier to wipe crumbs away. Right now, the metal part is not full flushed on the top of the toaster, so crumbs can get in between the metal and plastic part.
1206	B0000A1ZMV	RCRV24ZPDI5GU	Cuisinart CPT-120 Compact Cool-Touch 2-Slice Toaster, White	Burn hazard !!!!	Although the bread toasts evenly, the metal area surrounding the slots becomes so hot that I had a blister on my finger from a burn I sustained while just touching the area!
1207	B000R4HHGO	R1393DD0IKZ4Z8	Proctor Silex 22608Y Cool-Wall Toaster	It's a toaster!	For the price and the fact that I just wanted something to toast bread/bagels, it's great. Sure there are better models and products out there, but given the price point, who can complain? I've had no issues with burning myself or my bread, and the cord's positioning and length don't seem to be an issue.
1208	B000B18P96	R1PI5TW9N674DB	Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher	Ok, but not great quality	I've now had this toaster for three years and I've only used the egg feature twice. Both times that I used it, the egg turned out weird. It was too wet and puffed up to an extreme size.The actual toaster portion has always been ok, but in the past few months it's turned basically worthless. For example, this morning I put in my Toaster Strudel on the highest setting and it came out still mostly frozen in the middle. The outside, however, was a nice crispy/warm brown so if I would re-insert the Toaster Strudel the outside would end up burning. I've also tried cooking the Toaster Strudel at back-to-back medium settings but it doesn't help, either.I'm definitely going to be shopping for a new toaster this weekend.
1209	B004JMZGM2	R2IMQXSXOE3FW3	Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler	Love	Love the look, the way it works, and the space it takes up. It is larger than my previous toaster oven but not by much. Its performance is so much better than my old one. Recommend
1210	B004LZQJLE	R2A587RFWLKDKD	Hamilton Beach 2 Slice Metal Toaster	Color & quality are great	The color is perfect for the kitchen.  The toaster works very well & we are well satisfied with it.  We like the fact that we can toast bagels & english muffins as well as bread.
1211	B007P6H24E	R339HAM4MNCE74	Oster TSSTRTS2S2 2-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless Steel	poor at toasting	I had purchased a toaster that was half the price and it did not toast evenly.  Thought spending twice as much would do the trick.  This model had good reviews BUT I found it did not toast evenly. One side of the bread is darker, other side considerably, noticeably lighter.  Have to flip bread around to make both sides even.  Also if you toast twice in a row at the same setting, both batches are very different.  It's going back.  I just want a toaster to toast the bread, evenly.  Did realize that was asking so much!
1212	B0000A1ZMV	R2V42NFCZI7DBT	Cuisinart CPT-120 Compact Cool-Touch 2-Slice Toaster, White	It does the job.	It looks less than elegant to my rarefied eye, but it functions perfectly. My one big gripe: the energy-waster light that stays on perpetually when the toaster is plugged in. Feh!
1213	B000B18P96	R2SRIM43GSN8X	Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher	Tasty Egg Muffin in 4 mins, no more drive to McDonald.	I can not believe making a restaurant quality tasty Egg Muffin at home in just few minutes.  No more drive to McDonald for me.  It is awesome to make Bagels with wide toaster slot.  I really enjoy the every penny I spent.
1214	B006OQSO8E	R38428MZYDDDOL	Cuisinart CPT-420 Touch to Toast Leverless 2-Slice Toaster	Best toaster I ever owned	Absolutely love this toaster.  I gave the Salvation Army four toasters last year because of uneven toasting.  This toaster toasts both side of the bread evenly.The controls are perfectly designed for easy use, and it is extremely light weight which is important to me since I do not leave my toaster out on the counter.  Worth every penny I paid for it.
1215	B00140SC64	R2MIQRGRQSYV2G	Breville BTA820XL Die-Cast 2-Slice Smart Toaster	Goodbye Dualit, hello Breville!	Well, first off, let me say this: NOTHING looks better than the classic, Dualit toaster. Now let me say this: If you're interested in toast, NEVER buy a Dualit toaster. It's a mean and hurtful machine, designed to make you cry into your poorly toasted toast at the $350+ you parted with. SO, this Breville was bought to replace the Dualit 'Lite' (Yes, it was their $150, 'cheap' model) 4 slice toaster.  I was dubious about the 'automatic' motor drive system to lower and lift the toast, but it works fine, AND, best of all? THIS IS THE BEST TOASTER I'VE EVER HAD. Great, even toasting, slice after slice. I'm very happy with this purchase, even though I fear from the looks of it it's part of the Cylons 'plan'.Buy it, and let Dualit know their art pieces aren't fit for actual cooking.
1216	B0000A1ZMV	R2R1CTJ351CFA6	Cuisinart CPT-120 Compact Cool-Touch 2-Slice Toaster, White	LOVE THIS TOASTER!!	THIS IS A GREAT TOASTER!!  I have no idea why it has so many bad reviews.  I would recommend this toaster and I would buy it again!
1217	B0014IKQKG	R2R5CHV8091GS4	T-fal 8746002 Classic Avante 2-Slice Toaster with Bagle Function, Black	Does not toast evenly	Loved all the features and the look.The big sell for me was the carrying handle.  We store our toaster in the cabinet and the handle makes it easy in and out.BUT...see pictures from other customers this toaster does not toast evenly.The bread sits in the toaster at an angle...not sure why they had to design this way since they have the extra push up and out handle.  So the bread sits at an angle and browns the same way...half toasted.  Very disappointing.Find another toaster, stay away from this one.
1218	B008YNFB3Q	RC1CZP076WDUU	West Bend TEM500W Egg and Muffin Toaster	Hot Damn, This Shit Makes My Morning	Every morning.  This toaster is the sole reason I wake up at all, otherwise I would continue to slumber in peace.
1219	B003ZDNKRE	RUM1B6B7GY75E	Black & Decker TR1256B 850-Watt 2-Slice Toaster with Bagel Function and Removable Crumb Tray	Works	Looks good, a bit plastic-y, the controls feel fragile, though probably won't break. I have some other B&D kitchen stuff, and they seem more substantial.This toaster tends to dry out the toast too much, I use a medium setting. If I butter it right away, it's not a big deal.
1220	B000A1FFZE	R1E0QVLOZZ5W5	Hamilton Beach 22708 Toastation 2-Slice Toaster and Mini Oven, Black	A kitchen essential - highly recommended	We have used this oven almost daily for nearly 6 years now and it has never let us down. It is simple to switch from the over mode to the popup toaster mode by using the clunky sliding switch, just don't forget to take out the small tray when using it as a toaster. It won't hurt the oven but you toast won't get direct radiant heat from the lower heating elements.This is great for toast and bagels using the variable width pop-up, and for croissants, pastries and warming pizza slices etc in the small oven. It is much quicker and more cost effective that using the main oven for warming small items and better that the microwave which can make pastries soggy.After so much use the glass door does not shut perfectly anymore, but it's still used daily in both capacities.A kitchen essential in my opinion.
1221	B000QA1224	R2HN6CSFK4RBO1	Back to Basics TEM4500 4-Slot Egg-and-Muffin Toaster	Nice device	I recently purchased this item after a lot of research.  I read a lot of reviews, good and bad, but decided to give it a try.  It works just like advertised.  There are very clear instructions, including a measuring cup for the water that is cleverly marked to help make the process easy.  I made egg sandwiches with no effort.  Unlike making poached eggs in a conventional way, these eggs came out very nice.  I have also made hardboiled eggs and they came out perfectly.I'm a little skeptical about combination products, but this one works very nicely.
1222	B0026IG6LQ	R3EIGHUDQJR8RP	T-fal TL6802002 4-Slice Digital Toaster, Black	Wonderful Toaster	Wonderful toaster! I purchased this toaster after buying a cheaper one at Wal-Mart that did not work. I have had it now for about three month and use it almost everyday for my kids. It works great and I would highly recommend it.
1223	B0026IG6LQ	R3PMW6XSZ2QG2N	T-fal TL6802002 4-Slice Digital Toaster, Black	Example of when digital is not better	Overall a frustrating item.Pros:1.  Reasonably priced2.  Nice features with Bagel setting (toasts inside while just warming outside), Frozen item and reheat.3.  Audible alarm when toast is done.4.  Cool touch sides5.  Lift mechanism to lift up toast that's "too small"6.  LED indicator to show how much time remaining.7.  Wide long slots easily accomodate bagels, large slices of rye bread etc.Cons:1.  Coarse granularity on timer makes getting the "perfect toast" impossible.Ok.  So with 7 very nice pros and 1 Con how can I only give it 2 stars?The primary function of a toaster is to toast bread/bagels/poptarts etc.  With the older analog toasters you turn a dial to set the desired "doneness" of your toast.  Through trial and error you can learn that setting it at the exact spot you can consistently get a certain type of bread to toast to exactly the right golden brown you want.  This is frequently in between to "settings"  but since it's an analog dial that's ok.This toaster, however, has numeric settings.  For me setting 1 with white bread barely toasts it, however setting 2 toasts to a medium brown, I'd say it's about 15 seconds too long.  Because my choices are just 1 or 2 I can't adjust that.  I can't set it to "1.75" for example.  For this reason the toaster is less than useful for me.  While digital controls would be ok if I could set it using a wider range (think microwave where I can adjust power levels or I can adjust time) this just lacks the level of control I need :(
1224	B009GQ034C	R16U2XYN1RKTV3	Cuisinart CPT-122 Compact 2-Slice Toaster	Great features!	This toaster is awesome!  Always stays cool!  And so many features it makes toasting a delight. Even has a cancel button...
1225	B003ZDNKRE	R3OAZ0BULKET0A	Black & Decker TR1256B 850-Watt 2-Slice Toaster with Bagel Function and Removable Crumb Tray	Black and Decker Toaster Dead on Arrival	I ordered this toaster because of the price and positive reviews. As always with Amazon Prime the product arrived promptly and was securely packaged. That's where things went down hill pretty quickly.  Upon opening the box I noticed the toaster body is made almost entirely of cheap looking plastic.  Next, I go to plug it in, and realize that the cord is pretty short. After re-arraigning some items on my kitchen counter I finally got it plugged in.  However, the toasters plunger would not descend down far enough to engage and turn on the heating element.  After feeling a little foolish for needing help to operate a toaster, I called the Black and Decker help line.  After 22 mins. on hold, the customer service representative confirmed that the toaster was not operational, and suggest I return it.  The problem is that the cost of returning the product is almost half the price I paid, and I still have a cheap looking toaster.  Eventually the customer service representative agreed to send me a new toaster if I would just cut off the power cord and mail it in.I'll say this; at least the Black and Decker customer service representative did make an effort to rectify the problem.  And if they replace the broken product as promised, within a reasonable period of time I may change my rating to provide for at least making an effort to address the problem.
1226	B006OQSNYY	R3AHOH50F9AV8Y	Cuisinart CPT-440 Touch to Toast Leverless 4-Slice Toaster	Working well so far,good quality	Toasts very evenly ,browns eggo's perfectly on frozen setting.I used the bagel setting which browns the face side well but doesn't heat the bagle though.Works better on regular toasting setting.End of cycle beep not annoying like some others. 3 year warranty is a plus over other brands.So far very pleased with quality and operation.
1227	B0026IG6LQ	R399AZFB29RTHK	T-fal TL6802002 4-Slice Digital Toaster, Black	May I propose a Toaster of the First Order	We wanted a simple, 4 slice toaster that did not take up the whole counter and actually toasted bread and bagels without fuss.  We bought the T-Fal for that solution and only wish we had bought it a few years ago.  I decided on a simple approach and set the timer to the mid range instead of going from the bottom to the top and trying to remember which one was the best.  The middle range worked perfectly for me the first time and it is now the default setting.  I sure wish everything could be that simple.  While doing other chores the countdown timer is working within sight and the dinger goes off when complete.  The crumb tray is easy to take out and clean.  The push up handle elevates the bread to a satisfactory height for removal.  The black color is unobtrusive and few finger prints show even though they are present.It is wonderful to have products that have advanced the art of cooking.  This is one of those.  I recall as a child we would put two pieces of white bread on either side of the toaster and plug it in so the coils would start cooking.  We would keep an eye on it and when you either smelled it burning or were lucky and caught it in time you could open the doors and the bread would slide down so you could return the bread to the coils in an effort to cook the other side.  What a pain compared to this product.  Hoorah for technology and all it has done for us.
1228	B000B18P96	R2U9V0QOTRR5PB	Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher	Way better than McDonalds!	I bought this for my male roommate and he LOVES it! There is rarely a morning when he doesn't use it. Some days it's bagels, others are english muffins and they create the best McMuffins I've had. I'm really happy with this product!Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher
1229	B005TK76DU	R3IERFURRU5F0C	Cuisinart CPT-2000 2-Slice Long Slot Motorized Toaster	This was a gift and they are still thanking me	This toaster was a gift and the couple I gave it to (a former student and wife) are still thanking me. It is wide enough for bagles or for toasting buns or for a thick slice of home made bread. The toast gradations do really work for really light to a dark brown for cold dark mornings. I myself have an older model (actually two one in my Michigan house for summer and one in Florida house for winter). So I am an experienced Cuisinart user of this and many other products. Highly recommended
1230	B0026IG6LQ	RZKB6I3LZPEIU	T-fal TL6802002 4-Slice Digital Toaster, Black	uneven toast	Purchased for the end to end design. All of the functions work as expected. Price was competitive. Doesn't toast evenly ever.
1231	B000R4HHGO	R2GN61JAASXBV8	Proctor Silex 22608Y Cool-Wall Toaster	Excellent toaster	This toaster toasts bread quickly and evenly. The slots are thick enough to fit a nicely sized bagel and the lever to turn on the toaster seems sturdy. I've been using this product for over a year now and it still works like new. All in all, this is an excellent toaster and I would recommend it to others.
1232	B000A1FFZE	R23WRI8RVJ324C	Hamilton Beach 22708 Toastation 2-Slice Toaster and Mini Oven, Black	Nice but not perfect.... nevermind	I really like it and have used it 15 or so times. The down side is a small one (well two) the top where you put the bread in will let heat out, but I knew that when I got it and a cutting board on top works just fine. Something that I didn't see in the review was the switch where you go from toaster to toaster oven won't stay on oven, it will move just a fraction and it makes the oven part go off so while I'm using the oven part I have to keep an eye on it to make sure it's toasting. But it really is a great product and the two small problems I found can be easily fixed and I don't know why Hamilton Beach hasn't fixed it yet, seeing how it is a crazy huge company.4-11-13 Update... Last night I was toasting an English muffin in the bottom oven part and the toaster caught on fire. I don't know how it happened; I cleaned it out like once a week...  So just sayin if you cook with it, keep an eye on it so you don't burn your house down.PS The toaster is totaled changing rating to 1 star...
1233	B009GQ034C	R2JXGPNJTUCEY1	Cuisinart CPT-122 Compact 2-Slice Toaster	Attractive, Light weight. Doesn't feel substantial.	So far it makes toast. Not outstanding, but attractive on the kitchen counter.  It  worth what we paid for it.
1234	B003A09ARG	R2POQ6TJWER9K5	Black & Decker TR1400SB 4-Slice Stainless-Steel Toaster	Needed a 4 slice toaster for larger family	The only thing I don't really care for is the size of this toaster.  Luckily, I also have a large kitchen with plenty of counter space, otherwise I would return it for that reason alone.
1235	B002GHBSCO	RFBW7M2MIA4V9	Black & Decker T4569B 4-Slice Toaster, Black	good toaster	Received the toaster and have been using for about a month.  Does the job well, takes a little experimenting to understand how it works...which side to put bagel in vs a piece of bread.  I've toasted buns and it works out OK.I'm satisfied.
1236	B0000A1ZN1	RY2MXP6TLIJRA	Cuisinart CPT-180 Metal Classic 4-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless	Great Retro Toaster	We really love our Cuisinart toaster.  We did alot of research and few toasters offered both the look we wanted combined with all the great options this toaster has.  We particularly liked the red as it adds the right dash of color to a kitchen already full of stainless and black.  We also love the retro look as this also fits perfectly with our 50's kitchen.
1237	B005BWMMCQ	R3KELUK7HGPK79	Breville BTA630XL Lift and Look Touch Toaster	Breville Does the Toasting Good	Ann, my wife, had seen and used a Breville at a friend's house, so we bought one.  She was absolutely correct -- wide range of settings, it takes in big slices of bread with ease (no need to cut off the crusts), handles bagels with aplomb, and has a versatile and useful set of operating options (e.g., look and see, do a bit more).  Appreciated the pricing and the prompt delivery in a well protected packaging.
1238	B0026IG6LQ	R3E47CL3JU98FQ	T-fal TL6802002 4-Slice Digital Toaster, Black	Would not recommend	I wish I had never bought this toaster; I should have gone to Target and bought whatever they had for under $15.  One side comes out dark and one side comes out 1/2 toasted.  If a $15 toaster did that, I would almost expect inconsistency.  I expect consistency with a $40 toaster.
1239	B008LTIYN2	R1DXH4AGDTE0DE	West Bend TEM4500W Egg and Muffin Toaster	Great for breakfast, fast, and easy.........hard to clean though	I have been waiting for this to go on sale for a while and when I knew I could get it for $50 with free shipping I jumped at the chance to try it.  This thing rocks! The only issue I have with it is that the heating element that boils the water is hard to clean.
1240	B000B18P96	R2D6BW6U77J2RY	Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher	Toaster plus	We've used this toaster/egg cooker several times now and really like it.  I wish we didn't have to spray with pam - but other than that we are very happy with it.
1241	B0026IG6LQ	R2WLCY5STK70KS	T-fal TL6802002 4-Slice Digital Toaster, Black	The only thing...	The only thing I would change at this point is the placement on the power cord. I think it is in the wrong position. Should it be placed on the end away from the front of this machine, yes!
1242	B005PO77DE	RF57KKXA6WPVS	Waring CTT400BK Professional Cool Touch 4-Slice Toaster, Black	4 holer	This toaster was too big for our counter - never used it - it's the size of a Volkswagon bug!
1243	B004JMZGM2	R3QP3URII13ADQ	Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler	Somewhat Disappointed	I just got rid of my Delonghi, after, what seemed like forever - it was THE BEST - unlike the new ones they are showing - I think I had that toaster oven for 20 yrs - the only reason I did not purchase that brand again is because of the lack of temp. control - I purchased the Cuisinart because of the wattage power and the reviews - however, not having an interior light is really an extremely poor product design - seriously - that is not why I gave it 3 stars, but does add to it - I am more than rather disappointed in the fact that it does not cook consistently - example; I like baking Sweet potatoes in the toaster oven - with the thought in mind that the potatoes are the same size, sometimes it takes an extra 15-20 minutes - I never ever had this problem with my Delonghi
1244	B005Q8X6IO	R29W9151RX8IMV	Nostalgia Electrics HDT-600RETRORED Retro Series Pop-Up Hot Dog Toaster	Great gift for a kid	Gift for an 11 year old that loves hot dogs. Beautiful red toaster like hot dog maker that toasts the buns and cooks the hot dogs to perfection. Lots of fun.
1245	B000B18P96	RJFAC2FQBUKY6	Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher	totally awesome toaster!	I was a little skeptical at first, especially after reading that the material is plastic, but this is a very sturdy and somewhat stylish toaster. I think it looks a lot better real life versus the pictures online. It toasts my toast and poaches my egg, all in a very straight forward fashion.  I would totally recomend this product. I kind of think i should have bought the larger model, because there have been a couple time that i have had a guest over and it would have been nice to get both eggs done in one shot.  However, the single one works fine and does not take up much space, so i am happy.
1246	B0026IG6LQ	R3S6B8JOUFDGRF	T-fal TL6802002 4-Slice Digital Toaster, Black	Great product!!	I love this toaster.  The slots are very long and wide so that you can fit just about any size slice of bread.
1247	B003A09ARG	R1Z4GFKJOWGPJ4	Black & Decker TR1400SB 4-Slice Stainless-Steel Toaster	Works very well	The problems others have had about retrieving toast are easily remedied when you pull up on the toast lever(for lack of a better word). We have only had the toaster for a week or so and we're still figuring out our toast preferences but we are very happy with it. And we can toast 4 slices at once! Which was all we wanted in the first place.Also it's very pretty.
1248	B00A157JS0	RRUJAZZI0I1WY	Russell Hobbs 2 Slice Toaster	Good looking, multiple features and great performance	I was happy to replace our old, basic toaster that we have been using for the last 5 years. It wasn't always the most consistent of toasters, but we made it work. When the Russell Hobbs 2 Slice Toaster arrived I actually read the user manual.  That is not something I normally do with a toaster, but this had enough buttons that made it necessary for me to figure out what they were for. You have the frozen, re-heat, bagel and eject buttons.  There is also a 1-6 dial for setting your toasting level, too bad it doesn't go to 11.  The design of the toaster is very nice and will compliment many of todays kitchen appliances with the black and stainless steel look. I was concerned that the size was going to be larger than I would like, but it's footprint was similar to our former toaster. As for the most important part? It toasted like a champ!  I prefer a crispy, well toasted bagel and this did it perfectly on the #4 setting.  As for regular toast I found that #3 was just right and with a frozen english muffin again #4 worked great and it's the frozen setting that really sold me. We are not big consumers of bread products in our household.  It's more common to toss a old loaf, that it is to finish one. So being able to toast right from the freezer with good results will save many a loafs, bagels and muffins from the composter. Overall I am very happy with our new toaster and would recommend to others and the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is the price.  As with some of the other Russell Hobbs appliances, I feel that they are slightly overpriced.  For me this toaster should come in around $35-$40 maximum.
1249	B001ARQYRU	R21KA93ZLRYVRE	Hamilton Beach 2-Slice Toaster - Brushed Metal	Okay	I do not toast very often so this serves my need well. Toasting is a little uneven but acceptable and the outer surface stays cool, just as advertised.
3200	B0000A1ZN1	R3RTHK19HXMPAW	Cuisinart CPT-180 Metal Classic 4-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless	Toasts Bagels great	I have purchased other Cuisinart appliances in the past and really enjoyed them. This Toaster lives up to the name and toasts Bagels evenly on setting 3  1/2. Would have expected it to weigh more and feel more commercial but who really wants a heavy toaster.
3201	B00064W93G	R3B4OI3Z2DCXUT	Proctor Silex 22605 2-Slice Toaster	It works fine for me.	I bought this one for my own use because I cannot share a toaster with other family members.  I use it for toasting Gluten Free bread and it works fine for that.  I do find that with Udi's bread, if it's dried out a bit I have to push the button down for a bit more browning and then have to unplug it mid-stream to keep the bread from getting too brown.I'm satisfied with it. And it's find for this price!
3202	B00064W93G	R3RTZGD8VU0QQK	Proctor Silex 22605 2-Slice Toaster	Doesn't Pop up easily	The toaster's only down side is that if you want to stop it toasting you can't get the lever to come up. You have to unplug the toaster and than it pops up.
3203	B000B18P96	RM789ZZ3YO6CP	Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher	Convenient and delicious start to the day	I've had this thing for about six months now (I think).  My roommate and I both use it every morning to make breakfast.  A sleeve of english muffins, a box of Morningstar breakfast sausage patties, a carton of eggs, and you've got delicious breakfasts for the whole week.  If you get fat-free english muffins, you're only looking at about 200-300 calories too, and plenty of protein.  Putting it all together in the morning takes about a minute, probably less, then you can just go get ready while it's cooking.  It's not greasy or disgusting like McDonald's fast food, but actually makes you feel like you ate something substantial and healthy.I never write reviews for things on Amazon, but this thing has become such an integral part of my day to day routine that I had to come and give it five stars.  If it were to break tomorrow, I'd just buy another.  For ~$30-40, you can't beat it.Notes:Do get non-stick spray to use on the little egg panDo give the bottom of the egg cook area a wipe every once in a while, and do it right after cooking with it, it'll be well-steamed and easy to cleanDon't expect it to clean your dishes or do your laundry - it doesn't do thatDo enjoy a healthy breakfast on the regular, and have a good day afterward!
3204	B000R4HHGO	R1O2F6629OKXP	Proctor Silex 22608Y Cool-Wall Toaster	Excellent toaster for two slice	I certainly would recommend this toaster to anyone. It provides fast and even toasting every time. It's attractice and the price is exceptional.
3205	B0026IG6LQ	R1RPIBKALWHR0I	T-fal TL6802002 4-Slice Digital Toaster, Black	Love this toaster	This is the best toaster that I have ever owned.  You do have to adjust the setting depending on what you are toasting. I set it to 2 for raisen bread and 6 for English muffins. Then digital number is easy to remember and set. It browns much more evenly than any other toaster I have owned.  The progress indicator is great. The long slot is nice for oversized bread.  I haven't tried the reheat feature, but will try it the next time I cook eggs and toast.
3206	B005PO77DE	R1OIUVGQAIQYU3	Waring CTT400BK Professional Cool Touch 4-Slice Toaster, Black	Best toaster I've ever had	The toaster is a good looking piece of equipment.  The light-dark control is very smooth operating and accurate.  The manual pop-up is on the light-dark control so you don't have to, and shouldn't, pull up on the handle.  And when done, if you push up on the handle, it elevates hard to retrieve items (like English muffins) up a little so you can grab on to them.  I'm very pleased with the toaster.
3207	B000R4HHGO	R4YIACRLW9A3K	Proctor Silex 22608Y Cool-Wall Toaster	Good value	This little economy toaster operates as advertised.I would have give it 5 stars except that the way the cord comes out at the front is inconvenient.  I wonder why the manufacturer decided on that design?I like the way that odd shaped pieces of bread are easy to remove when they are toasted.
3208	B000A1FFZE	R2SLOFH9BEYGJY	Hamilton Beach 22708 Toastation 2-Slice Toaster and Mini Oven, Black	The smallest quality Toaster oven around	I live full time in a luxury 45' Motor Coach. Space is the most important commodity. This Toaster Oven is an excellent combination of good looking, very small and very functional. I love it!
3209	B004LZQJLE	R2600E7RC1WOD2	Hamilton Beach 2 Slice Metal Toaster	I love it!	I am glad my stainless steel toaster died. This red toaster is so beautiful! (and it makes toast too ?)
3210	B0043BG916	RH85136Y8SJOC	2 Slice Toaster	Ts - 260 2 Slice Toaster White	I purchased this toaster on ebay. The reason I purchased this brand of toaster was because I had recently bought a Brentwood Iron and was very pleased with it's quality.If you are considering purchasing this toaster, PLEASE!PLEASE!PLEASE!, save your money. The quality is so poor, and the bread slots so narrow, you are hard pressed to fit the bread into them. I had the toaster on the lowest setting when I made my first few slices of toast and they burned badly. The second two slices of toast also burned.I took the loss and threw the toaster out. I'm truly surprised someone would manufacture something so utterly useless.
3211	B0026IG6LQ	R5RRGUE45AVWY	T-fal TL6802002 4-Slice Digital Toaster, Black	Does not toast evenly	This toaster is very cheaply made. It probably weighs 10oz. I'm exaggerating but it does not weigh much. The toasting was very uneven. It would burn one edge and the other would be barely cooked. It gets so hot and the plastic all around the outside is so flimsy it causes concern. I did like the fancy light up blue bars.
3212	B000153ZXS	R237D5AAXUX4RO	Cuisinart Compact Cool-Touch 2-Slice Toaster, Red	Red toaster	The Cuisnart Red Toaster would have been a good buy at the original price. At the delivered price it is a fantastic help in this depression!
3213	B002CVTT3Y	RPC9PK8NH8D8V	Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven	Gimped Toaster	Everything about this toaster is cheaply made.1.) The crumb tray doesn't fit properly as one side sticks out 1/4" due to poor metal forging.2.) The toaster never keeps the elements on for long enough. It will take forever to toast something, as once the element gets red hot, it's shut off soon after, then left off for 30 seconds or so until it starts up again. You can hear the thermostat click over in side the toaster and shut off the elements. So even on toast setting the oven bakes everything instead of toasting. Pathetic. I bet they did this "quick fix" to stop this toaster's poor track record of bursting into flames and shattering its glass door.3.) Just like other cheap toasters, the labels around the dial will rub off over time.4.) Power cord is WAY too short. I know it's a safety thing, but the least they could have done is give a few more feet. Two feet of power cable is pathetically short.Don't buy this unit: avoid at all costs. Worst excuse for a toaster oven I've ever seen from Black & Decker. The brand name means nothing anymore with the cruddy products they've released like this toaster.
3214	B00140SC64	R2S8ITVKJDFZXX	Breville BTA820XL Die-Cast 2-Slice Smart Toaster	Nice toaster.	This is a nice toaster. Toasts well and evenly. The "bit more" function and the audio indication of the toast being "up" are nice features. Hope it is a long lived unit as it is certainly more expensive than most
3215	B004JMZGM2	R25KWJHOX8OX6O	Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler	awesome product	the guys love the product they use it every day of the week would recommend this product to my friends
3216	B000B18P96	R1S6I4MDBO222N	Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher	Very nice so far	I am the kind of guy who likes breakfast food but rarely can be bothered to do anything not absolutely required before work in the morning (and I still manage to be late most days).  For many years my typical breakfast has been a diet coke in the car on the way to the office.  I bought this appliance in the hopes that the lure of a tasty breakfast sandwich would tempt me to get up a couple minutes earlier than I absolutely had to.  So far it's working.I have had this thing for about two weeks.  I've made 7 egg sandwiches.  It took a couple tries to find the water level that resulted in an egg that way I like it (I prefer the yoke completely cooked but still orangish and not hard, in my machine that equals a splash over the "medium" line in the cup).  Since finding the right water level, it has been consistent.The complaints about meat dripping into the egg are valid but its a simple thing to remedy.  I just drain the egg pan into the sink before dropping the egg onto the bread.  You could use a paper towel if you really don't want any juice getting onto your sandwich.The meat tray has no problem making frozen (precooked) sausage patties hot.  I haven't experienced any problems with the bread getting cold or the nonstick coating coming off the egg pan yet... still wondering if that might be an issue later.  For $30, I won't be expecting it to last a lifetime.  When you consider the ingredient costs vs. a mc-breakfast, it really doesn't have to last that long to be worthwhile, not to mention the convenience and health benefits.  If it lasts a year I would be totally pleased and ready to buy another.
3217	B0000A1ZN1	RRBBB3RGCQ5U1	Cuisinart CPT-180 Metal Classic 4-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless	Waste of Money	This toaster is a complete waste of time and money.  Uneven toasting from Day 1, and now one side does not work, less than one year later.  The repair person said it is the solenoid that switches on and off when toaster is plugged in.  Cuisinart does not even give you the option of returning or repairing on their website.  About the only thing about it is it looks decent sitting on the counter - give it a star for that.
3218	B002CVTT3Y	R3QMGEC78604BW	Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven	Like it and maybe love it!!	I think this toaster oven is a great size! Works really well too. The only thing is a i wish it was a little bit bigger because the rack can only fit on the top shelf part and if you lower it the door doesn't really close well. BUT other than that it is a great product. Would recommend!!!
3219	B0026IG6LQ	R1YPUDHTA41YV2	T-fal TL6802002 4-Slice Digital Toaster, Black	Strangely uneven and quick to break but . . .	We were looking for a toaster that could handle long slices AND bagels . . this seemed to be it! At first, we were generally pleased with the way it worked though we noticed, right away, that the settings weren't always consistent. Sometimes level 2 would be enough to toast a piece of bread . . . sometimes you needed level 5 . . .sometimes 1 . . .you get the idea. It toasts pretty evenly and does handle the larger sizes except . . .We noticed, after a few months, that the mechanism inside the toaster is pretty flimsy. Sometimes things would get stuck, even if the bread itself wasn't particularly fat. Sometimes it wouldn't pop up all the way and, over the months, we could see that the parts that hold the bread were getting out of alignment a bit. Eventually, perhaps after a year of use, the pieces inside were bent and, on one side, no longer stayed on the track.When the toaster works, it works well. The size is perfect and it even looks nice. It just isn't built that well. Trouble is, for the price, it's one of the few toasters that can do two bagels at once or a long piece of homemade bread.As long as you keep in mind that it might need replacing in a year or so, it's not the worst purchase.
3220	B004JMZGM2	RRQY5P1ECUD4T	Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler	Love It!	Love the push button for toast vs. a timer you have to twist, not too big and not too small
3221	B0000A1ZN1	RFCBFC7K9J2OJ	Cuisinart CPT-180 Metal Classic 4-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless	NOT GOOD ENOUGH!	Toastes very unevenly. One side good the other nothing.Like the bagal option.My old B & D was much better.
3222	B008YNFB3Q	R2OZ3GW2394K8G	West Bend TEM500W Egg and Muffin Toaster	Worked perfect for me.	Works exactly how it should.My egg and bagel or muffin are always done and perfect everytime.I slap some cheese and a slice of ham and in 5 min i'm breakfast bound.I honestly can't find a thing wrong with this awesome toaster.
3223	B000FCTOHS	R2078TYRTDD4C7	West Bend 78224 Quik-Serve Toaster, Black	Great product	Toast very evenly great Product when toaster pops out its a little loud but I really like it. I would recommend it also if you don't have counter space it's really wide.
3224	B004JMZGM2	R1K6ECSDQTRP8I	Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler	Heats and toasts FAST.  But has NO timer.  Dials hard to read. Burns bread.	The main positive is that it heats and toasts really quickly.  And it is compact and looks good.  The negatives:  1) The automatic slide out rack can become disconnected and almost fall out if you're not careful.  2) It's really hard to see the selector on the dials.  It is just a small raised black line on a black dial.  I have to bend down to look for it every time.  In low light, you will not be able to set the heat settings.  3) The biggest issue is that there is no timer, so you could leave the oven on, creating a fire hazard, if you're not careful.  I know this is a user issue, but for a unit at this price level, there really should be a safety mechanism built into the oven.  Cannot recommend, mainly due to the last two negatives.UPDATE 2-13-13This has got to be, hands down, the worst toaster oven I have ever owned.  Besides the items above, which continue to be an issue, this oven/toaster consistently burns bread on the bottom back side.  The rest of the toast is a very light, barely toasted brown.  The bottom rear is burnt to a crisp.  Our office is uniformly hates this toaster.  Unfortunately, It is going in the trash.
3225	B004LZQJLE	[DISAPPEARED]	Hamilton Beach 2 Slice Metal Toaster	Great	Love the line of colors for kitchen accessories, this toaster works great, is cheap and does not show finger prints.
3226	B000A1FFZE	R3PHH65BWJKV3Y	Hamilton Beach 22708 Toastation 2-Slice Toaster and Mini Oven, Black	Great idea, but it burns everything	When our toaster died, a bit of research made this seem like such a great idea. Small counter space, wide toaster slot and a bit of an oven. And, we found it in the perfect shade of red that matched our other counter-top appliances.Unfortunately, it burns everything put into the oven. Even at low temperatures, the small size means the heating element is too close and by the time anything is heated, it's also black on top.Then it turns out the toaster slot is wide, but short. You can easily fit in a half a bagel, but it's too short to get in both halves.Worse, if you try to cram anything in, even just a little, it gets stuck. Any bread that's soft and not perfectly flat will get stuck when it pops up and get smashed up against the heating element.If you never put anything in except a very small pizza slice and toast only pre-sliced white bread, it's probably a great little machine. But for anything even slightly out of the ordinary, it just plain doesn't work. You'll find it really cheap at our next garage sale.
3227	B003SGSZE6	R2KMB7ZJ2PN16L	Cuisinart Classic Stainless-Steel Toaster: Cuisinart CPT-160 Metal Classic 2-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless	Terrible toaster, even worse customer service	I bought this toaster about a year ago and unfortunately, it just never worked properly.  At the time I read all the reviews and they seemed pretty good (even toasting, looks great, works on all sorts of breads, etc).  My problem was that the toaster timer did not work.  At first I thought it was because I was using frozen waffles in it, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and manually handled the toasting.  After about a month and MANY MANY burned waffles and bread slices, I tried to contact cuisinart support with my issue.  No response.  Tried again a week later...  again no response.  Essentially their support is non-existant.  So, another problem with me is that I tend to throw away packaging whenever I purchase something, so there wasn't really an easy way to return this toaster.  Plus I figured it wasn't worth the headache to try and get a refund.. all I really wanted was for the company to correct a wrong they did.Anyways, for the past year, I have just tended to avoid toasting things since this thing isn't reliable.  It was only the other day I had to toast something which reminded me of how bad this product is that I decided I need to post a review to help prevent others from falling into the same pit I did.  Definitely will never buy Cuisinart again.
3228	B004JMZGM2	R3T44DLHN4AU74	Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler	Brave Little Toaster!	We pretty much make toast, bagels and english muffins with our toaster, and we love it.  The bagel setting is particularly cool.  It's easy to use, and I don't miss the tick tick tick our old toaster used to make.  We also have warmed pizza in this toaster and it also does a nice job with that.  And the pull-out crumb tray is a big hit in our house.  Really makes cleaning easy.  A few little quibbles - the dials aren't easy to read - it's hard to tell whether the dial is pointing at toast vs. bagel vs. bake.  You have to put your finger on the dial to see where the little bump is to figure out what it's pointing to.  And that will occasionally make you start baking your toast rather than toasting it, if you don't check beforehand.  Or, you can set it to toast way too dark by accident.  A minor issue in an otherwise great device.  Also, we'd prefer the top and sides were stainless steel, rather than black.  But these are very small concerns.  If it's durable, we'll have this one for a long time.
3229	B000B18P96	R3DJ7QBO3WFU1B	Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher	A Great Product	We are retired people. My husband has his eggs and toast every morning and this product was a blessing. Now he gets his toast and egg at the same time, where before he had to put his bread in the toaster and poach his egg on the stove.  The old toaster only toasted part of the bread, but this toaster does the whole slice. Thank You for a Great Product.
3230	B004O07MAI	R1RCQVVFM6YMZR	Proctor Silex 2 Slice Bagel Toaster	good for price	great addition to our red applianced kitchen wares and it works well but some times the toast seems a little dark so you dont need it up very high at all, maybe it runs a bit hot? we like it and is serves its purpose.
3231	B002GHBSCO	R3M1CQL14ZTM08	Black & Decker T4569B 4-Slice Toaster, Black	Short tail!	Haven't tried to toast anything yet, just set it up.  Very light and fine aesthetically speaking, but takes up a lot of counter space and has a very short tail! (cord).  Ours is next to the outlet, but the cord starts at the opposite end of the toaster and barely reaches.
3232	B0007Y17WO	R3JEDC8Y96O1Q0	Sunbeam 3911 4-Slice Wide Slot Toaster, Black	Sunbeam toaster	It has one problem so far...very often when I press the levers to start the toasting process the levers will not stay down and I have to repeat the process several times before the bread will stay down
3233	B002CVTT3Y	R1M5H0W5P0CKR8	Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven	"They don't make em like they used to . . . "	After many good years with my old B&D toaster oven, it was time to get a new one. That's an understatement . . . when your daughter scream's, "Dad the toaster oven is on fire, come quick" . . . well its time to get a new one. Actually what happened on the old toaster oven was the button you push down to toast, got stuck, and her 2 mini bagels caught on fire. Of course she pushed the button down left the room, and came back to "toasty conditions". The handle melted, the toaster oven was history.  I liked the old toaster oven for the simple reason it was easy to toast bread, bagels, etc. You push down the lever and it toasts the same every time.Of course, B&D probably went to the "twist the dial" timer toaster option after a few of these older toaster ovens caught on fire, the way ours did. It's not just B&D toaster ovens that have saddled the consumer with the new twist the dial toaster oven, others have the same unfortunate feature. The main reason I don't like this "twist the dial" to toast option is because you don't get the same result each time you toast. Each time you have to guess at where to stop the timer, resulting in either an "not toasted enough" result, or a "too toasted" result. Maybe in time, I will get used to the new dial option.This toaster over gets three stars. It's OK, or good enough, but nothing to write home about. In addition to not having the old push down button, and toast lever, it has cheap, light, feel to it. Also, the the wire grill that you lay the item you want toasted (or baked) on, has a "hook" on it, which enables it to slide out as you open the door, but many times does not close very smoothly, you have to "jimmie" it a bit to close. In my opinion, a poor design.In summation: an OK toaster oven, it functions, but nothing special.
3234	B0000A1ZN1	R3V5EQKWXPW6HI	Cuisinart CPT-180 Metal Classic 4-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless	Dissapointed	We had a Cuisinart 4 slice toaster for several years that did exactly what a toaster is supposed to do untilwe discovered our cat on the kitchen counter one morning.After scolding kitty and thoroughly cleaning the counter top we found evidence that a mouse had been on the counter top as well.We cleaned the counter again and found evidence a mouse had been under our beloved toaster. No doubt looking for bread crumbs.Concerned with the prospect of disease and no way to clean the toaster,we had no choice but to discard our toaster and buy a new one.We purchased a replacement four slice Cuisinart and it arrived in a few days.It was obvious it was not the same quality as our first Cuisinart and the lift levers really feel cheap.They feel like they might break at any moment. To add insult to injury the toast comes out dry and inconsistent.We're inclined to return it and buy a different brand but it is becoming clear that appliance manufactures are just going for the quick sale instead of building quality products that will bring customers back.That's what we tried to do.
3235	B002CVTT3Y	RX6VVNIHDU1UP	Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven	toaster oven	problem with the door. not properly alligned. returned to shop wise for a refund
3236	B002CVTT3Y	R3CN0RQ33NU9GN	Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven	excellent for the $$	Bakes, broils, and toasts evenly.Great slide out crumb catcher. Excellent value for the money. I would recommend to anyone !
3237	B009GQ034C	R2TVIT7Z86808X	Cuisinart CPT-122 Compact 2-Slice Toaster	Compact 4 slice unit	Gave it as a gift.  Heard that it makes good toast and the dual control is a plus when two people like theirs different colors.
3238	B002CVTT3Y	R2TK6SDQ99N9P8	Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven	Great toaster oven though stated measurements are incorrect	This is a great toaster oven for the price.I was looking for a smaller type of toaster oven and was not thinking of this one due to the stated measurements. I however saw it at a friend's and realized it was smaller than I thought.The actual measurements are:16" Depth x 8.5" tall x 10.5" deep
3239	B0014IIS6A	R3USCWP3C6QICR	T-fal 5332002 Classic Avante 4-Slice 6-Setting Toaster with Bagel Option, Black	Extremely Disappointed	This is the second time I have ordered this exact same toaster. Both toasters did not function properly straight out of the box. The two right slots barely lit up while the two left slots got bright and hot. I returned this toaster...again, and ordered an entirely different brand. Once is a possible bad appliance, twice or more is a bad product period.
3240	B003ZDNKRE	R18J1I9YXLKZNT	Black & Decker TR1256B 850-Watt 2-Slice Toaster with Bagel Function and Removable Crumb Tray	Great	First one I bought didn't work at all. Exchanged it and the second one works amazing. No frills toaster, except for the bagel setting which I think is neat. Setting 5 toasts bread perfectly
3241	B00829HUTK	R3FO8YNYI4Y1ZW	Domo Toaster	It toasts.  Just no Domo face.	I bought this for my girlfriend because she's obsessed with Domo.  The idea behind this toaster is a novel one but so far have not successfully planted Domo's face on a single piece of bread.
3242	B004JMZGM2	RGVSEH0BS4C2B	Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler	toaster oven	not happy to find that there was not timer for broiler and baking.................  otherwise, find that it works just fine
3243	B000A1FFZE	RSYCSORB0ITF8	Hamilton Beach 22708 Toastation 2-Slice Toaster and Mini Oven, Black	The little toaster oven that could!	We are an office of 18 and boy do we love hot toasty food. Our old toaster over (same make and model) was a beloved work horse 6 days a week for 3 years. We recently had to retire it after someone tried to toast and oven at the same time. This thing will get the job done....from fish sticks to frozen waffles... you will not be disappointed. Also, the new cancel button is sweet!
3244	B00064W93G	R1H142Q7GS0WGA	Proctor Silex 22605 2-Slice Toaster	TWO YEARS LATER...AFTER FIVE YEARS, STILL GOING STRONG, SO KEEPING THIS FOR NOW AFTER TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING NEWER/BETTER	THIS IS AN UPDATE TWO YEARS LATER (01/13)...STILL WORKING AS DESCRIBED BELOW...KEEPS GOING AND GOING...I'm writing this review out of frustration re: trying to find a new toaster, and we're now going to keep this one, and you may want to give it a try, too.  To wit: We bought this for a little over $10 at a mass market store more than five years ago.  It's still going strong.  Biggest drawback is that it's a bit slow, but you learn to time that while getting other things done in the kitchen.  Toasts pretty evenly, the selector dial is dependable to get the done-ness you want. For english muffins, a second toasting can be needed, but it is even.  We just tried an Oster and returned it, toasts one side black if you get the other side even slightly brown. Same with a Cuisinart that we returned from Christmas. It's really a jungle out there trying to find a decent toaster for under $100.  And, btw, re: other reviewers' comments: you can force the toast up if you want to, it just takes a little effort, and after five years of doing it, the handle shows no signs of breaking from the pressure.Today's manufacturing being what it is, I suppose you can always get a bad one, but if you get one that works, this is a fine little toaster.  BTW: Be sure to empty the crumb tray once in a while, as it actually does keep the crumbs in, and if you get a big pile going, that can affect toaster performance.  IN SUM: If this toaster toasted a bit faster, I'd give it five stars. And until we have at least $100 in the budget for a new toaster, we've stopped looking and will keep this little gem. The exterior of ours is a little worn looking, doesn't really fit in with the rest of our brushed steel/chrome counter appliances, which is why we decided to look for a new one, but it toasts dependably well, which is more than I can say for those last two $50+ models we tried.
3245	B0026IG6LQ	R1LGL3IS1Y3RAJ	T-fal TL6802002 4-Slice Digital Toaster, Black	Uneven Toasting	Bagels - great - it toasts one side nicely.  HOWEVER, I can not get a piece of white bread to toast EVENLY!!!
3246	B0014IKQKG	R25JJE97WM3TRE	T-fal 8746002 Classic Avante 2-Slice Toaster with Bagle Function, Black	Looks pretty	I would give this about 2.5 stars.  It's pretty, and I'm not sure what another reviewer was saying about only 1 side working.  - I just purchased this mainly for the pop up button before the burn.I didn't think it was worth the extra $ for the pretty slant effect.
3247	B0016CPGYQ	R387U3PPFGFKHN	Proctor Silex Cool-Touch Toaster	Sturdy toaster	We'd just ruined a $125 toaster by burning a corn taco in it, when I read a magazine's thumbs up for the under-$20 Proctor Silex. It's good. Survives minor fires inside it, and has a nice sliding heat range. My only problem with it is that thin slices of bread slip down and have to be pried out with a fork -- which the toaster doesn't mind, evidently. Sturdy and small.
3248	B002CVTT3Y	R150QQMSVC8D3E	Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven	Convenient	We love this toaster oven.  It fits nicely on our counter w/o taking up too much space.  It's great for nights when we do nuggets or other quick foods.  Much better than turning on the oven.
3249	B00140SC64	R3P30B2XY3GZZT	Breville BTA820XL Die-Cast 2-Slice Smart Toaster	Sandwich lovers, rejoice!	If I were stranded on a desert island and could bring only one kitchen appliance, it would be this toaster.It's elegant. It's heavy duty. And it makes perfect toast, each and every time.My family lives on bread. I've tried every toaster ever made. This is by far the best.It toasts evenly on the outside of the bread, but the inside stays moist!It fits bagels easily, and has a dedicated button for its special needs. There is also a separate Defrost button for your frozen waffles.I love how there are no levers, so you can't be tempted to pop it up and ruin the toasting cycle.Press the button, and the toast descends. The blue LED lights show you how long it will take till it's done.Want to check how your toast is doing?  Just press the button that says "Lift and Look" -- and the bread comes up slowly for you to inspect.Want it to toast a bit more?  Just press the button that says "A Bit More."It's ingenious. And beautiful. It feels futuristic, and yet it couldn't be simpler.Really, I love this toaster.
