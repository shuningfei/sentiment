1150	B00541OAZG	R38EVFH8OF84U1	Nostalgia Electrics RMO-400RED Retro Series .9 CF Microwave Oven, Red	Super!	The controls are great, it's really good looking, and it works fine. What more could you want?  This is not a big microwave, but it does everything I want.  Even the popcorn setting is perfect.
1151	B0009KMYDM	RE3EY7KTI2BMN	Panasonic NN-H965WF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Nice oven with a few drawbacks	Our twelve-year-old Kenmore finally died.  After a lot of research, we finally decided on this brand and model.Pros:This is a large oven.  Anything that doesn't fit probably should not be cooked in a microwave anyway.  It is a powerful oven.  Things that took 90 seconds in our old oven only take 60 seconds in this one.  Function programming allows you to turn the clock on/off and the beeper on/off (see Cons).  Operating noise is very low.  Full-power cooking requires only setting cook time and pressing start.  The "Sensor Reheat" function works well as long as your food is not covered (and anything with tomato products or beans probably should be covered).Cons:Our biggest complaint is the noise it creates when closing the door.  This produces a very loud, tinny clang that can be heard all through the house.Although it is a large oven, it is lightweight and quite often pushing the door release will slide the entire oven backwards.Changing the power level requires pressing the power level button multiple times - e.g., defrosting at 30% level requires pushing the power level eight times.  Our old oven required only two - power level and 3 on the keypad.Likewise, setting nine minutes on the "Quick Min" function requires pushing the "Quick Min" button nine times and then pressing start.  Our old oven required only pushing "Quick Cook" and 9 on the keypad (without having to press start).The keypad had no tactile feel.  If you turn off the beep function, you need to pay close attention to the display to make sure the key you pressed actually activated.  Turning off the beep function also turns off the end-of-cycle beep.  Since the end-of-cycle beep is not nearly as loud and irritating as our old oven, we chose to leave this function "on."Conclusion:Although not perfect, we are satisfied overall after using this unit for two months.  Based on a number of other reviews, we did purchase the extended warranty.
1152	B00785MVRA	R2AS3AW0G1ONQN	Panasonic NN-SD372S 0.8 cuft 950-Watt Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	Good, Versatile Microwave	This microwave lives up to the claims made in its description.  The defrost mode works quite well, without starting to cook the food.  There are many useful modes, for reheating, cooking from frozen, and keeping foods warm.  The sleek stainless steel design is also nice.The only drawbacks are a lack of a number pad, which makes entering time a little bit more of a hassle, and that the reheat mode seems to heat things too much.
1153	B005BFZ5TU	R3CXAY0J7LYM61	Panasonic NN-SN651B Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Panasonic NN-Sn651B Genius 1.2 cuft-Watt Sensor Microwace	Great for the small area I needed for.  Good for cooking and warming.  Black with white lettering is very attractive.  Great buy.
1154	B0009KMYDW	R16P45YAHKOKB6	Panasonic NN-H965BF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Needed Repair Before 30 Days Old	I've been a Panasonic fan for years until I purchased this microwave.  I searched every local dealer for a full-sizedblack Panasonic microwave. Local dealers only had smaller, stainless models in stock.  So, I did what I said I'd never do and buy an appliance online.  Never again.The microwave arrived on December 9, 2009 and today, January 3, 2010, is displaying Error H98: "Problem with microwave generation system. Contact authorized dealer."  The nearest authorized dealer is a 60 mile round trip--120 miles total for dropping off and then picking up--a lot of effort for a $150 purchase but too much money just totoss out and say lesson learned.There is no quality in any manufacturer anymore.  I'll never base a purchasing decision on brand name again.
1155	B004WOBWF2	R3RI98CLIHU754	Kenmore 79159 Elite Black 1.5 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave w/ TrueCookPlus Technology	Kenmore elite black 1.5 cu.ft. countertop Microwave w/ TruecookPlus	This microwave is 1) the perfect size, 2)comes with excellent directions for using the technology, and 3)cooks beautifully!  It's just large enough without looking huge on the counter. The "add one minute" feature is wonderful for making gravy, or for adding just enough heat when you need it.  Highly recommend!
1156	B005BFZ66C	R329LXFK7N347O	Panasonic NN-SN661S Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	Powerful and elegant!	Sure beats the heck out of our old white Wal-Mart microwave.  Before when a meal said 3 minutes, we would cook for 4 minutes and still have cold food.  Now we have quicker meal prep and, to top it all off, it looks great!  Very happy with this purchase!
1157	B005BFZ5ZY	R62D3M3L8ASQD	Panasonic NN-SN651W Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Great and powerful microwave	I have a similar model at home, but I bought this for the office. It's got lots of power, and has a versatile keypad, which means you are not limited to 5 second increments as you are with some microwaves. We mainly use it for heating food and it has worked perfectly fine for that. I would buy another one. And the Panasonic microwave I have at home is 12 years old, and works like new.
1158	B005BFZ66C	R3KMX9VI6CF89C	Panasonic NN-SN661S Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	Great product	Great microwave, very powerful, with easy to use features. The turbo defrost feature really comes in handy too. Highly recommend!
1159	B005BFZ5TU	R2UIWPWDIGH1EQ	Panasonic NN-SN651B Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Perfect for my needs	Works great, does excellent job with frozen dinners. Fan is a bit noisy when unit is in use but I've gotten used to it and hardly notice any more.
1160	B00180LXWA	R26BCDWKG989QZ	Haier MWM0701TB Compact 2/3-Cubic-Foot 700-Watt Microwave Oven, Black	Good microwave for the price	This is a good microwave and very reasonably priced. The dimensions on it however are incorrect. It's small but the measurements listed it as being 11.5 x 19.5 x 14 1/5 and the measurements are actually 11.5 x 17 x 10. The inside of it measures 10 3/4 wide and 11.5 deep. This is ok if the largest thing you're heating up is a dinner plate. I used one of those plates for microwaving bacon and it just barely fit. I had to cut the paper towel I usually place on top of the bacon to reduce splatters the exact shape of the plate because it kept catching on the walls and folding up. It also takes a little longer to heat items up which is to be expected since this is a lower wattage. I think we'll be selling this and getting one that is larger with higher wattage. I've only been using this for a week and there have been no issues with it functioning, but it's a little too small for our needs.
1161	B000EMSVKK	R3I9ZLNONUK06Z	Just Like Home: Microwave Oven	18 month old loves it!	Boys love buttons, and toddlers love to "help" around the house, so this little microwave is a big favorite of my son.  It has buttons with food pictures that you press to choose a time, and then you press start.  The turntable spins, and it light up, whirrs and beeps just like the real thing.  This set comes with enough dishes and play food to get started playing kitchen.  I paid 15 at TRU, which feels like about the right price to me.
1162	B005C2QM3U	R2KKOD4JOPF3U9	Nostalgia Electrics RMO-400BLK Retro Series .9 CF Microwave Oven, Black	Cute oven... but doesn't work for too long.	This is a cute oven.  I only wish it were a little more powerful.  But it's a second microwave for me, so I use the higher-wattage one if I need more power.  Mostly bought it for looks!  It arrived in good time and was as described.** UPDATE **I received this around the end of June 2012.  By around the end of September 2012, it had stopped working -- the timer and fan turn on, but it does not heat anything up any more.  As it is a second microwave which I mostly bought for looks, I may see if it is worth repairing.  But as far as functionality goes, I'm afraid they put everything into the looks and not the works.  Too bad.
1163	B005BFZ66C	R2UQNXGQ50FA8Q	Panasonic NN-SN661S Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	Typical microwave	Overall this is a decent microwave.  I think the style and look is good.  It's a little on the noisy side when it is in use, but it does what it's supposed too.  I have not had any issues with it and probably have used it almost every day for the past few weeks I've had it.
1164	B0009KMYHI	R35KU6SMJTNAYA	Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	A uWave with a smart and a stupid button, sort-of.	This is a basic microwave oven with some cool features and a very mediocre user interface.  You can enter time and press cook and it works.  It has a power button that reduces cooking power by reducing continuous cooking energy, not, as most do, by cycling on/off at full power.  This is good, but the button is stupid.  To set power 3, you have to push the power button 6 times.  It decrements from ten, one digit per press.  It also has a "quick minute" button, which is good, but it, too, still requires that you press the "start" button.  Not as quick as my old uWave, which just starts when you press the quick-buttons.  I also wish there was a "quick 30 sec", which I used more than anything on the old oven.  There's also a "smart reheat" button that's great.  It heats until it senses steam/heat given off the food.  But it's also stupid, since there's no control over the power level.  (Panasonic doesn't document this feature very well, really.)  There's a "Smart Cook" button, that also cooks by sensing the steam/heat given off by the food.  It would be way cool if you could figure out the cooking profiles, but they don't document that, either--they just say "potato" or "frozen pizza" and assume they know how to cook it.  Again no power control, and no way to use it if you don't happen to be cooking potatoes or one of the other 8 food items listed.  You also have to press this button between 1 and 9 times to select the food group--again a stupid button trick.All in all, it's a fine appliance at a good price.  Its biggest shortcoming is that the user interface could easily be so much better.
1165	B0009KMYDW	R32MIETYOZBBH	Panasonic NN-H965BF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Great Microwave	Microwave works great and I like all the different features.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because every now and then it will disrupt my internet service when it's on............not always though, just every once in awhile

TrueCookPlus Countertop Microwave -6633	Every aspect of this purchase was accomplished in a timely and efficient manner. The product far exceeds expectations.  I would recommend this product to a friend.
1167	B0009KMYDM	RJW600M41SZYX	Panasonic NN-H965WF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Huge Microwave	I got this for my girlfriend for the holidays as her 10 year old GE seemed to be taking longer and longer to heat things up.  When she opened her gift I heard things like "Wow, that is huge." and "I'm not sure that is going to fit."  I had asked her before hand and she said that bigger is better, but from the measurements alone you don't get a good feel for how enormous it's going to be.  It doesn't seem to cook any faster, but that is to be expected being as it's the same wattage but a larger size.
1168	B00180LXWA	R12MG4DP68X8AO	Haier MWM0701TB Compact 2/3-Cubic-Foot 700-Watt Microwave Oven, Black	4 yeas and going strong	Great smaller unit,  I got it for a smaller apartment.. use it for heating coffee, left overs, soups, and small plates,  Works great.  Defrost a snap.  I have really got my monies worth.. I use every day and have had it about 4 years.  Longest I have it on is for 5 minutes.  If I need longer cook time just restart for another few minutes,  May be why it has not died on me.  I find it reliable and easy to clean... simple microwave for simple uses.
1169	B0009KMYHI	R21M92ZUUBLZ6P	Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	IMPROVED OVER OLDER GENUIS MODELS	Works as expected, exactly fits where the old P. Genius was and has more inside room!  I really like the function button & the reminder beep. No more finding something in it the next day that I forgot about!
1170	B00785MVRA	R13HA8ER4FUSW3	Panasonic NN-SD372S 0.8 cuft 950-Watt Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	Better than expected!	I have had this microwave about a month now. It replaced an 1100 watt microwave and I was hesitant to purchase one that had less power, but this microwave has surpassed my expectations. It cooks evenly, is fast and very quiet. I highly recommend it!
1171	B004WOBWF2	R2QACPG8QCWMVS	Kenmore 79159 Elite Black 1.5 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave w/ TrueCookPlus Technology	Buy This!	Sears Kenmore is always tried and true.  But this works better than the more expensive built-in microwave (by GE) at twice the price.
1172	B0009KMYDM	R3J88WGKJUNDEL	Panasonic NN-H965WF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Spacious and smart!	Big microwave, fits a family pack of chicken thighs no problem.  Love the inverter turbo defrost enter the weight of the frozen item and it thaws it out every time without cooking it one bit.  Popcorn setting runs a little long have to pull the popcorn so it doesn't burn.
1173	B005BFZ5N6	RZQZM76IKH9WD	Panasonic NN-SD681S Genius "Prestige" 1.2 cuft 1200 Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Readout, Stainless Steel	Great mico wave.	Use daily. It is a high powered micro wave and very straight forward to use. The only negative is the light doesn't come on until you power on.
1174	B001DIMXMG	R21OR2X7TGIIW9	Haier MWM0701TW 700 Watt Countertop Microwave, White	Great purchase!	I'm a college student who just moved to a small apt without a microwave so I needed something small but hardy enough to handle whatever I needed it to handle. It came within two days and everything was where it should be. I've had it now for about two weeks and its great! I mostly use it for warming up my food and I have no complaints whatsoever!And I know there's been some complaints about the sticker on the front but it's really nothing to worry about. As soon as I opened the box, it took me like one minute tops and I slowly and carefully removed it with no trace of the sticker even having been there. Seriously, it's nothing to worry about.I say buy it if you're looking for a small but durable microwave.
1175	B0021YMIIK	R1X03S25X1JOLU	Kenmore 1.2 cu. ft. TrueCookPlus Countertop Microwave - 6633	product good - shipment no	this is the ideal inexpensive utilitarian microwave with everything you need - unfortunately two of the three wheels were broken off the turn table when it arrived. We glued them on and it works.
1176	B00180LXWA	RJLVHCXGV7VWY	Haier MWM0701TB Compact 2/3-Cubic-Foot 700-Watt Microwave Oven, Black	Died within 4 months of purchase	At first things were going well...but just as my father always taught me...you get what you pay for, son. This was cheap, easy, and quick fix for replacing another, more expensive microwave that finally died after 4 years. It barely made it 4 months. The extra $20 might make a huge difference. I learned my lesson.
1177	B0009KMYHI	R2SLUH0PG1UC0S	Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Very positively impressed! Five-Star-Rating called for!	Bought the Panasonic NN-H765BF Full Size 1.6 Cubic Feet, 1250-Watt Microwave Oven, Black, for wife, and both of us are very positively impressed! Five-Star-Rating called for!
1178	B005BFZ66C	R2E1839Z2PDL16	Panasonic NN-SN661S Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	Microwave Oven	Excellent.  Very good quality.  Easy to use and to clean.  Heats foods evenly and at right temperature.  So happy I purchased it.
1179	B005BFZ5TU	R1H92NAFTNPJJV	Panasonic NN-SN651B Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Great Microwave!	The staff in our office wore our last microwave out.  This one replaced it and it was just what we were looking for.
1180	B007TIE160	RDRJR4SY6IAQQ	Oster OGZB1101 1.1 Cubic Feet Digital Microwave Oven, Black	GARBAGE!	This is a total piece of garbage microwave. Less than two months after I received it from Amazon.com it failed. The unit powers up, and the turntable turns, but it generates NO heat whatsoever. Even amazon admits there is a problem with it, yet they will not accept a return on it. OSTER doesn't even mention it's existence on their website, and there doesn't seem to be any warranty for it. What a piece of CRAP. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS! And by the way, AMAZON - you have a terrible return policy on this product.
1181	B000ON6HMS	R3OSPVKL8NQIQ1	Panasonic NN-SD797S Genius "Prestige" 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Readout, Stainless Steel	Extremely Satisfied User	I was on the hunt for a larger countertop microwave when I found this one on Amazon.  I was a little skeptical on purchasing with all the up and down reviews but went ahead and purchased anyway.  After using this microwave for a few weeks, we are extremely satisfied.  We can cook more than one item at a time due to its large capacity, which is a real time saver!  In addition, we feel that this microwave does a good job cooking or defrosting in sensor mode (unlike our previously owned models).  We cook all the time at home, so we have high expectations of functionality, design, and reliability when it comes to microwaves and this model meets all of them!  This was worth the purchase, but we just wish it had an "add 30 sec" button.
1182	B005BFZ5N6	RO052EHNLCJEJ	Panasonic NN-SD681S Genius "Prestige" 1.2 cuft 1200 Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Readout, Stainless Steel	Powerful, Even Heater	We use a microwave primarily to heat up cooked foods and liquids, bake potatoes and pop popcorn.  The Panasonic is a powerful unit and the "Inverter" feature does seem to heat the food more evenly.  Our old GE unit would do a good job of heating the edges of the food items and leave a cold core, but not the case with this unit.  The dial is a handy feature, whether using it to set the clock, timer or cook time.  I did read other reviews expressing concern over the fact that a light doesn't go on when the door to the microwave is opened, but this is really a non-issue.  There is no problem seeing what is inside the 1.2 cubic foot space unless one is using it in complete darkness.  The only negative to the unit is that it is a fingerprint magnet, as are most stainless steel appliances.  However, in the case of this microwave, it is really quite difficult to shut the door without touching the stainless--would have been more convenient for a small touch pad on the door to avoid having to constantly wipe off the smudges.  It is a good looking appearance and cabinet, and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well.Our unit does have a rather loud beep volume, and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other Panasonic microwave models.  This unit isn't five-star-perfect, but for the most part we are very satisfied with it.  Good bang for the buck.
1183	B0009KMYHI	R2SZIRYNI1BGV9	Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Terrible Product - Don't Buy	I was initially pleased with this microwave until it quit working after four months of use.  I called Panasonic because it was still under warranty and they gave me a case number to have the microwave repaired.  It has been in the repair shop now for 4 weeks.  Try going 4 weeks without a microwave.  Wish I would have just bought a microwave from Wal-mart...at least I could have just returned it and gotten a new one.  Going through Panasonic warranty and repair shops is not worth the wait.  Its tough these days living without a microwave with a large family.  We have definitely made some changes and can't wait to finally get our microwave back.  I mean I wish I would just go buy another one somewhere else...but then eventually I would have 2 microwaves which I do not need. When speaking with Panasonic I couldn't help but to think they knew there was a problem with their product before they put it on the market.  I can't believe this is the quality coming from a Japanese company.  Can't believe they wouldn't just send me a new one rather than have me go to a repair shop.  Needless to say...I will not be purchasing another Panasonic Microwave.
1184	B007TIE160	RTZT0M8DQ0Z7E	Oster OGZB1101 1.1 Cubic Feet Digital Microwave Oven, Black	It's big and stainless steel, I must buy it.	Works great, pops popcorn in 2 minutes! Its a bit big, but I think that's just because we have zero counter space. I love the size I never have to worry about popcorn which is the main reason I use it!
1185	B0009KMYDM	R393EDGB1NT4AN	Panasonic NN-H965WF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Never Buy Panasonic again	We purchased this microwave after reading the reviews and initially we were really pleased with it. Then after about 8 months the magnatron went out. Luckily it was under warranty and Panasonic did repair it but we were without a microwave for 2 weeks.  It worked fine until 4 days after the warranty expired and the magnatron went out again. A microwave should last a lot longer than 4 to 8 months.  Unbelievable.
1186	B00180LXWA	R2N20MAG9I5QJC	Haier MWM0701TB Compact 2/3-Cubic-Foot 700-Watt Microwave Oven, Black	Dead after 4 months	Bought at the end of August and just died on me tonight when I was making popcorn. Really weird. I tried to open the door after the popcorn got done but instead of the door opening the microwave just turned on by itself with the microwave door button pushed in with no way to turn it off. Luckily the actual door did not open but the only way to turn the microwave off is to unplug it from the wall. As soon as I plug it back in it starts up again. Hope I did not get a dose of radiation if the door was not shut all the way......
1187	B005BFZ5ZY	R1ZCPPTG6FYG0E	Panasonic NN-SN651W Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Great for the price	I bought a new house and needed a countertop unit.  After searching through the stores and online, I finally decided on this model.  It's bigger but not so big it takes up an entire counter.  It's a great family-size unit.  No issues so far.
1188	B005BFZ5TU	R8TNNCEO4QAGW	Panasonic NN-SN651B Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	One hot micro	Bought this for daughter for her new home she loves it  price was great and shipping was fast she loves all the features

1190	B005GSZB7I	R3AFYGRI34ILOP	Whirlpool WMC20005YD 0.5 Cu. Ft. Stainless Look Countertop Microwave	Innovative functionality; why didn't they think of this before?	Most microwave ovens have a rotating plate inside with several inches to the side where the magnetron that provides heating power resides and the displays are situated. This one places the magnetron below, along with the displays; the interior exactly surrounds the 11 inch rotating plate. It ends up taking about 6 inches less counter space than conventional small microwaves, yet still holds large dinner plates. Controls are intuitive, and the power is adequate. It is sized and looks similar to a 13 inch CRT television set. We bought locally to avoid risking the large "restocking" fees charged by some of the Amazon vendors.
1191	B000ON6HMS	R2RRF35IOGZ6CP	Panasonic NN-SD797S Genius "Prestige" 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Readout, Stainless Steel	Works Great	I purchased this item about a month ago and I love it.  It is easy to operate and cooks food evenly.  My family loves it.  We use the microwave 2 times a day.
1192	B0009KMYHI	R3RNH3ZCM7QWEQ	Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Like the new technology	very nice unit. the new technology is great, i use sensor reheat quite frequently, it heats my dishes up nicely without getting so hot it burns you. Plenty of room, easy to use.

I especially like the buttons and controls. The discrete buttons provide good tactile feedback and are much nicer that those membrane switch panels most microwaves use. It was also an exact fit in the cabinet so that it almost looks like a built-in.
1195	B003YKS1NQ	REUSD3Q6LGKJ4	Oster AM930B 0.9-Cubic Feet Countertop Microwave Oven, 900-Watt, Black	Good little microwave	We bought it to use in the workshop. It works just fine with no complaints for what we purchased it for.
1196	B007TIE14M	R217VFAXL7ICVO	Oster OGH6901 0.9 Cubic Feet Digital Microwave Oven, Stainless/Black	Sleek and powerful with a small price tag.	I like the overall design and ease of this product. I like that the microwave beeps if you have left food in there after the timer has stopped. It's fairly powerful for its size and wattage and has been going strong for at least 9 months now so I can't complain as I see it lasting into the future.
1197	B005BFZ5TU	RX2F7ISDKW2FS	Panasonic NN-SN651B Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Panasonic 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave	I love this microwave even though all I've done so far is basic microwaving.  It's nice and fast, heats and reheats extremely well.  In time, I'll be trying some of the other features, but for right now, it's great for my needs.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs a new microwave.
1198	B005GSPVHS	R3PZPZHBSAUZPW	Panasonic NE-1054F "NSF" Approved 0.8 cuft Stainless Steel Commercial Microwave Oven, 1,000 Watts and Touch Control Keypad	This Commercial Oven is Great in Our Home	My wife cooks dinners on Sunday for the duration of the work week.  We reheat in the microwave all week, plus there are lots of other non-dinner microwave projects.  Our first microwave, back in the 70's, lasted close to 20 years.  All subsequent models have failed much sooner.  We got the idea to try a Commercial model, on the hypothesis that it would likely withstand routine usage for more years than a consumer model.  They usually cost at least 3X a standard consumer model, which was a bit daunting until our most recent consumer microwave developed a hole in the rear of the cavity.  The Panasonic has a sturdier feel, and unlike all but our original microwave, this has a stirred beam, not a carousel.  We really like it, and because the dish doesn't move, we can employ more or less square dishes almost the width of the cavity.  The cavity is actually slightly smaller than the predecessor, but is working better for big dishes as a result of the dishes not rotating.  I am now enthusiastically recommending Commercial models to friends and family.  The only down side is that our kitchen microwave projects now feel a bit like being at the company break room, or a convenience store.  On a related note, we now religiously employ a microwave food cover to avoid spatters and the "floor" is always covered with a (non-rotating) paper towel to keep the cavity in like-new condition.  Please note that this model doesn't have a clock for telling time and the done signal is a bit louder than most consumer models that we've owned, but it's still "all thumbs up."

This is a very large stainless steel microwave.  Its is attractive, easy to use, and heats foods very evenly.  At about $250, it was a real bargain.  It ilso is very lightweight for a microwave this size.  With Amazon Prime, I had it less than 48 hours after I ordered it.
3150	B005BFZ5N6	RYYN4S5V1AZY7	Panasonic NN-SD681S Genius "Prestige" 1.2 cuft 1200 Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Readout, Stainless Steel	The control nob is *not* a benefit.  Do not recommend.	Arguably 2* is a bit harsh, but I do actively recommend against buying this.It's a pretty good looking unit which generates microwaves like a champ - no complaints there.  The inverter feature is a definite benefit IMO.We haven't evaluated a lot of the complex functions in terms of how well they work.My big gripe though, is the design - specifically what it's like to control - i.e. the user interface.  It's the all-too-common interface designed by the embedded controller engineers, rather than from the point of view of the user.The control nob seems like it should be great, but setting the duration is not an improved experience.  You end up relatively slowly and carefully turning it to narrow in on your desired time.  It's not exactly difficult, but it certainly isn't as easy as tapping a digit or 3 to set a time directly.It's a high power machine so dialing it back makes sense quite often - and that's why it has the inverter feature.  However, for power you *don't* get to use the dial.  First thing I did was tap the power button then turn the wheel, but no, that would be too easy and intuitive; with the pseudo-analog power display to watch as you do it, unlike controlling time this would actually work nicely.  Instead, to get to 40% power you tap the power button 6 times to go from 100% to 40% in 10% steps.Any semi-advanced usage means consulting the book.  Are you softening a quart of ice cream or a stick of butter?  You need to know the right numbers to do that: 17 and 15.Fairly minor:The Aluminum front is a fingerprint magnetThe display blazes so bright it lights up the *adjacent* room at night.  We now have a post-it note stuck over the display at night.It's not quiet - not the loudest either.  I suppose that's barely a gripe.Overall, I when using it I'm just mildly irritated by the awkwardness of it, and regret the purchase.  Should have stuck with a tried-and-tested control setup.
3151	B00785N22I	R1DWYL6TH7Z5H9	Panasonic NN-SD962S Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	A good microwave but not as good as earlier model	I bought this brand and model without seeing it in a store because I had been very happy with a predecessor model that had finally quit after 11 years.  I began to be disappointed as soon as I set it on my cabinet.  I am not happy with the type and layout of the controls, which are counterintuitive and difficult to operate if you are trying not to use dirty fingertips.  The door opening mechanism, which had worked flawlessly on the previous unit, began to be problematic within two weeks, usually not opening the door without a second push and often requiring a light pull on the top of the door.  The unit does have good power and the sensors and turntable operate well. The inverter technology makes the unit light and the stainless steel exterior is attractive.  It is still a good unit but is a step down from the older model, which is not the direction of change that I expected, and indicates a reduction in general design and production quality for the brand.
3152	B0009KMYDW	R2O6MNDDOJOIGA	Panasonic NN-H965BF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Review of Panasonic Microwaves	I searched all over our town for a large Panasonic microwave that had all the features that I was looking for.  I needed one powerful enough to cook main dishes in, thaw food, able to handle large dishes and be black in color to match my other appliances.  The Panasonic NN-H965BF fit my needs but could only be found on line.  I love this microwave and it is easy to use.  I've had several microwaves over 28 years and they have all been Panasonics, the last one lasting for over 10 years (with heavy use).
3153	B005BFZ5TU	R32W8S5UITDQYU	Panasonic NN-SN651B Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Works really well	I like the size of this Micro, doesn't take up as much room as my last one, but has same wattage and better features. I love the reheat sensor, works perfect every time. Several people have mentioned how hard it is to open and close. There is a Child Proofing adjustment and I wonder if perhaps they set that by mistake? This is as easy to open and close as any Micro I've owned. Amazon has this priced very well, don't hesitate to purchase if it's the size, color and price that fits your needs.
3154	B000ON2TQG	R2NLYP6JPU3G7Z	Panasonic NN-SD997S Genius "Prestige" 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Readout, Stainless Steel	expensive piece of junk	I paid $170 for this big, expensive microwave.  It will not pop microwave popcorn properly, & the door is hard to open.  Worst of all, it quit working just AFTER the one year warranty & Panasonic will not honor the warranty.  All microwave ovens I've had in the past lasted over 10 years, & I expected to get at least 5 years out of this one, not just one year.
3155	B00785N22I	R1HNIVHT0270HN	Panasonic NN-SD962S Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	Yup, the best microwave I've ever had - redux	We bought this model microwave when our old one dies after a power surge at the house. After researching our warranty repair options, which would require 2 1/2 days off of work, and $120+ in labor charges, plus waiting a minimum of two weeks with no microwave at all to end up with a 5 year old machine, we decided to just buy another. After 5 years of using an inverter microwave, the choice was clear - just get the same model we had. That's this Panasonic. And out of the box, it has worked flawlessly, just like the first one did. No complaints.
3156	B00785N6V0	R3LK2B3P4S0FAI	Panasonic NN-SE982S Genius "Prestige" 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Electrostatic Dial, Stainless Steel	Very powerful, but not enough gradient controls	Has all manner of functions, and I have to keep the booklet handy every time I use it.  I thas a "minutes" button that scheduled run time in whole minutes.  When following directions to microwave a food product for 1 minute 30 seconds, you must schedule 2 minutes and stand by to stop it at 1:30.  Although seemingly very high tech, I would prefer a knob to the current way of setting time for other options.
3157	B002O0JQQI	R1MKY0523ASKYC	Sharp Half Pint Microwave Oven	Well made little machine.	Have had this microwave for 10 years and four moves and it is still going strong.
3158	B00785MVRA	RDQ4UUZEOFCZ5	Panasonic NN-SD372S 0.8 cuft 950-Watt Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	Compact unit works great, so far.	I bought this microwave because it had the most power of any compact unit. Only had it a month, but so far no problems. It takes up less space than my old Kenmore, heats quickly, and so far, I haven't found any hot spots. Small downside is the front panel does show fingerprints so more regular cleaning is required.
3159	B004WOF01E	R1TCP2JDFID9E3	Kenmore 79203 Elite Stainless Steel 2.0 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave w/ TrueCookPlusTM Technology	Very nice microwave for a very small price!	This is a very good looking, full powered microwave.  It has a lot of special features that we may never use, but they're there if we want them. The main reason I love this oven is because it is large enough to hold a 9"x13" pan.  The turntable works great and the oven is fairly quiet.  I'm very glad to have purchased it at such a low price.
3160	B0009KMYDW	R1S153KFB0GCKN	Panasonic NN-H965BF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Two problems in as many months	I own a number of Panasonic products.  In fact my previous microwave was a Panasonic and lasted for years before I started having problems with it.  So we bought this Panasonic.  I am very disappointed with this unit!  Maybe I just got a lemon.  But right off the bat the microwave's fan made a whirring sound at startup and shutdown, that was audible enough that I HAD to take it in for warranty repair.  During the heating the microwave was loud enough to drown the noise of the fan.  I was hoping that microwave technology in this day and age would make for much quieter operation.  We did not have a microwave for the 2 weeks of warranty repair since parts were not available at the Panasonic authorized service dealer and had to be shipped.  Then within a month of that problem, the microwave stopped heating right in the middle of a heating cycle, consistently.  It is now back at the service shop waiting for a part.  So, in the 3 months we have had the unit we have had two problems and not had the unit available for use for a month.  Very disappointing!
3161	B000ON2TQG	RVMGWYMWUK348	Panasonic NN-SD997S Genius "Prestige" 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Readout, Stainless Steel	You get what you pay for!	We've had this microwave for several months now, after replacing an old one that was having trouble (which 1/4 of the plate that it decided to heat on any given day was apparently determined by the phases of the moon, or possibly sun spots).First of all, this is a good size microwave.  If you are upgrading from a smaller one, be sure to check the dimensions listed in the product description before ordering.It's very well built. It gives the impression that it's probably going to last forever. All of the buttons, the dial, the door and its release mechanism are all very solid. The inner rotating tray and the rotation mechanism that it sits on are also well done -- even with a really lopsided load, the rotation of the tray remains smooth.The performance of this microwave has been stellar.  As mentioned in another review, the Popcorn mode is perfect -- I have yet to see a single burnt piece come out of a bag.  The "Sensor Reheat" mode has been spectacular for me as well.  Just put the food in, and press the button. I use it all the time for leftovers, and wow!  As a matter of fact, just yesterday I used it to reheat a plate that included ground beef, mixed vegetables, and a large amount of mashed potatoes -- nothing was overdone, and the mashed potatoes were hot all the way through!The unit itself is quiet -- it probably operates at about a third of the volume of my old one (admittedly, that's not saying much).  My girlfriend thinks it's hilarious that the display says "Enjoy Your Meal" after it finishes heating.There are a number of features that I haven't tried, since I haven't had a need for them yet.  If I end up using one of these features in the future, I'll update this review with the new info.All in all, it's a great machine. Easily the best microwave I have ever owned. It's expensive (mine was an open box item at a local retailer, purchased for $179), but the capabilities (and the distinct sense that it will last forever) make it a worthwhile investment.
3162	B00785MVRA	R23HFP8U9R3D22	Panasonic NN-SD372S 0.8 cuft 950-Watt Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	works quite well	I wanted an inverter style microwave oven to replace the aging microwave I had been using for the last 10 years.If you use the lower levels for warming soups and stews, heating frozen dinners and defrosting frozen food, this unit works great, since it can actually vary the power applied to the food, not just cycle it on and off. This feature heats the food more evenly, without over-heating the edges of the food. It excels at keeping food warm after the cooking or reheating is completed.I also like the LED interior lighting, which means it probably wont ever burnout and need to be replaced.The only minor issues I have with this oven: The labeling of the buttons, its hard to see in low light levels, and there is nothing on the display to indicate that the oven is indeed cooking at a lower power level like some of the other Panasonic ovens have.Overall the oven is an ideal compact oven for singles, couples, and maybe dorm use, or as a second oven for large families.
3163	B005BFZ5TU	R1AZOWZF94QGJL	Panasonic NN-SN651B Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	POS -- BUYER BEWARE -- Faulty MicroWave AND TERRIBLE customer service!	I will never order another Panassonic product in my life!  Immediately we heard a bad loud ringing sound in our POS Microwave and contacted Amazon for a return.  Panasonic intercepted, and would not let our return process WITHOUT a technician certifying that the microwave has a problem (what ever happened to "the customers always right?").  My wife takes it to the service repair jerk who tells her there's nothing wrong with the microwave AND messes up the reconstruction of the unit so now the frame is all warped.  AWESOME.  Now we are left with a deranged microwave and Panasonic won't take it back because some crap for brains technician tells us "nothing wrong with this unit."  It's buzzing so loud we have to leave it unplugged, never has the right time displayed as we keep unplugging/plugging it in to avoid the sound.PANASONIC SUCKS!  I will be boycotting ALL of their products from now on!!  We are good customers and did everything we were told to do and we're left with a damaged product which was broken OUT OF THE BOX and Panasonic won't lift a finger to help.AVOID AT ALL COSTS
3164	B004DMUBVE	R37ODB6V7SGFG2	Oster AM730B 0.7-Cubic Feet Countertop Microwave Oven, 700-Watt, Black	A semi-useful review (I hope) on the size of the microwave: it is small, and I mean SMALL...	I bought this microwave for the sole purpose of.... POPCORN. Yes, popcorn. I actually prefer Jiffy Pop Popcorn (it is the best popcorn, and I am a popcorn snob), but popping the Jiffy Pop on the stove is very loud, and living in an apartment, it is just not courteous to make such loud , rapid popping noises at 1 a.m....To get more to the point, the microwave works well, heating wise (so far), but it is too small for even a regular size bag of popcorn. Sure, if you want to eat a mini bag of popcorn, it is great... but if your comfort food is popcorn, and you want any of the following: regular size bag, Orville's movie tub, or the pop up bowl popcorn, you can forget about be happy with the size of the microwave. You may be later tolerant of it, because the regular size popcorn bag will stop getting stuck on the sides of the microwave once it is almost FINISHED popping, about, 15 seconds, give or take a few... but you will not be happy to know that it is impossible to get the tub or the pop up bag to pop all the way or correctly because there is not enough space, vertically.Not only is it just too small for my capacity of popcorn inhalation, the glass plate doesn't seem to like to stay where it is supposed to. However, perhaps it was shifting because, again, the popcorn bag was getting caught on the sides of the microwave. I dont really have much else to compare it to, because since I bought it, I have only used it a few times, and every time was for popcorn. :)Well, wait... I did use it to try and soften butter, but that is never a good idea to do in a microwave, so I cannot fault the microwave for melting the center of my butter after being in there for... 10 seconds. Definitely bad judgement on my part.  :/I will update on the actual efficiency of the microwave if I choose to use it for anything other than popcorn.But, for the people who are looking for an opinion on size.... it is too small for a regular size bag of popcorn.Also, I do know that at  .7cu it is supposed to be small, but when it cannot even fit a regular size bag of popcorn... well, that just makes me absolutely tweaky.P.S. always go with Orville (its worth the extra dollar) and try some Jiffy Pop if you haven't before.. you will never look at microwave popcorn the same way again... :)

We love our new microwave!  After using this for about 7 months, we have enjoyed to features if this microwave.  Our favorite details are the melt/soften feature (works very well!) and the sensor reheat feature.  No complaints thus far for this microwave!
3166	B007TIE1V0	R3ILUWFOOXQHJ	Sunbeam SGS90701W 0.7-Cubic Feet Microwave Oven, White	Dead after 10 months	One star because I hate that I spent good money on this microwave. We used it very little and mainly to heat tea water.  Stopped dead after 10 months use.  Should have gotten a different brand. Have you ever used Sunbeam batteries?  They don't work either.Update:  I may have spoken a little hastily.  I called these people and they were very nice on the phone but you've got to understand I was upset and my ears were full of tears from laying on the couch and crying over all that money I spent.  They sent me an e-mail with instructions on filling out the proper forms which consisted of removing the plastic label from the back of the microwave that had  the serial number and product manufacturing date and attaching it to the form.  Taking a pic of the cut power cord so they will know you just ain't saying this stuff to get a refund. (Would a guy named Slick lie?) And mailing it to them. A refund of the full purchase price should be sent to me in 4 to 6 weeks.  I can live with that. Even the best products break down sometimes. I'll let you know and will probably have to change my rating if they pay me back my mula.
3167	B0009KMYGY	R2RJ4SVK61BNUY	Panasonic NN-H765WF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Sufficient	Microwave is okay.  It is fairly big... It is most certainly powerful.  It just seems a little cheap? Maybe it's just me but I am used to over the counter units and have had some nice ones.
3168	B0009KMYDM	R3UX5YY2QXKZ11	Panasonic NN-H965WF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Great product, great price.	I really like this large microwave, it is very simple and has a nice clean look in the white.  The door is a bit noisy to close and that is the only thing I dislike because it seems overly hard and so I am thinking it may break but time will tell.  I would recommend this for the price.  My last one cost almost double and broke within a year - the one before that I had for 10 years so I guess you never know.
3169	B005BFZ5N6	R31LZDZFPALAEK	Panasonic NN-SD681S Genius "Prestige" 1.2 cuft 1200 Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Readout, Stainless Steel	I LOVE this microwave!	This is my third Panasonic microwave and yes, they frustrate me when they don't last. One lasted a year and the most recent lasted two years. Each time I looked and felt I would not get another one on principle, but I didn't find another brand I liked. This model is an upgrade and apparently from the one I had.  I love it more than the two previous ones and it seems better built. The appearance is simply cool, looking almost sci-fi. No kidding.  It feels solid, the door is solid opening and closing and it works beautifully.  Didn't think it mattered, but the blue light is in fact very cool.  I microwave a lot but not extensive cooking,  When my last one made loud noises, I knew I had to act as I couldn't be without for long. What a pleasure to look on Amazon and in two days it was on my door step. No lugging it from a cart to my car.  I pushed it in and it was up and running in literally five minutes.  They are in fact a "fulfillment center." :)
3170	B004WP0DJW	R3V4EUDSGCFTPH	Kenmore Black 1.2 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave 69129	Black Microwave	Very nice microwave.  Came packaged securely.  It is large enough to hold a medium sized casserole dish which is unusual with most microwaves.  I would definitely recommend this applicance.
3171	B003MGJ17W	R2JT7BPO384O98	Oster OGG3701 .7-Cubic Foot 700-Watt Digital Microwave Oven	Unevan Cooking and Loud	Bought this Microwave a couple of years ago, and for the most part it works fine.  It is very noisy, but that is not the major complaint.  I have never had a microwave cook as unevenly and this one.  You can prepare 2 exact meals and one will come out over cooked, and the other one will come back lukewarm.  For example, if you take 2 bowls of oatmeal, exactly measured for both.  You put the first bowl in, put the timer on 1 minute and 30 secs, and the oatmeal comes out fine.  You put the second bowl in there, and it comes out overcooked and extremely thick. Well, I thought, maybe as the Microwave heats up, it will overcook.  Not a chance!!  It will sometime overcook the first bowel of oatmeal, and the second will be fine, so it's not the longer it's on, the hotter it cooks.  It just makes up it's mind to overcook or not.  Their is no rhyme or reason.  Long story short, you have to stand over it, look in while it's cooking, so you won't have a ruined meal.  I'm probably going to donate it to the Good Will, and buy another one.
3172	B00785MVRA	R3Q30G4PCG93NT	Panasonic NN-SD372S 0.8 cuft 950-Watt Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	Microwave broken just after return window expired	Heard all good comments on this one. Bought this microwave during Thanksgiving time. Used very lightly for two months. It broke yesterday. Just after return window expired. Won't recommend it.
3173	B003VV5PNW	R218YWDOWG4TC5	Frigidaire FFCM0724LW FFCM0724LW Microwave Oven	Lacking specs	Does the microwave have no watt rating or cubic foot size?  Is it a powerless and sizeless device?  Is this even possible with our laws of physics?
3174	B0009KMYHI	R1AYPU14QL4A1L	Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Reliable	I trust Panasonic when it comes to microwave. Their microwave lasts for a very long time. It's doesn't' have that many fancy functions, but I am good with it. It cooks well. It dies on me after many years. The internal is large. Nothing much to complain about Panasonic microwaves.
3175	B005BFZ5TU	R1BRP9SNFEXZTO	Panasonic NN-SN651B Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Panasonic NN SN651B	Don't like it at all.  Very loud.  Hard to figure out.  Defrost should be call cook instead of defrost.  I bought a Panasonic in 1975.  It finally quit and I replaced it with this one.  OHHH, to have my old one back.
3176	B0009KMYGY	R3H8XSMCM0C57X	Panasonic NN-H765WF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Working like a champ	Update as of May 2012.Still running like a champ, buttons look like new.Who knows how many burned popcorn bags have ran through this :)..seriously, the inside top has turned black due to people burning things!..Wipe it down, air it out, and keep on trucking.I'd buy one of these again.-----------------------This microwave was purchased to replace an older unit that had been worn out at our office.  We have four microwaves that get an average of 50 lunches a day ran through each of them.  That and countless coffees, teas, burned popcorn! etc.  What we first noticed is it brought a cold cup of water to a boil in under two minutes!  The other 1200 watt microwaves need three or more.Upsides.  Quick and easy use.  Easy to understand buttons with a 1 minute or add a minute feature.  Going with white saved about 20$ off the black unit.  Thankfully the popcorn option works beautifully. No more stinky burned popcorn!Downsides.  Needs a better light.  It's hard to see your food in this oven.  Can be confusing options for setting the controls and clock.  Don't loose the manual!  The door button seems to stick but returns to normal when you close the door.  The bulb is not replaceable from the inside.The turntable can pop off the spinner, but that's not uncommon for these types.Cleaning is easy.  Well, as easy as it can be with an office of messy ba_tards that don't clean up after themselves. ;)

It had not done this before (but I've owned this only since May 21, 2012) and it never happened with my prior microwave. I am very concerned. First, the glass platter is broken. Second, I am concerned that this microwave is dangerous having done such a thing.I submitted the above information in the 600 word complaint/support form on the Panasonic website. I will report back what reply I receive, so that you can make up your mind on purchasing from Panasonic.

3178	B00180LXWA	R2XX9R2RE2HVF7	Haier MWM0701TB Compact 2/3-Cubic-Foot 700-Watt Microwave Oven, Black	Good microwave	The shipment was on time, no delay with that.The microwave is small sized and decent. Its ideal for students and working people. You can heat cups, small sized bowls. Normal sized plates do not fit in.As a student I liked this microwave.
3179	B0009KMYHI	R3RWC6PP8MVBBV	Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Great Microwave	We had a Panasonic microwave that gave out after 11 years, and we had one before that. My brother has had one for 25 years. We're happy with them.My wife wanted black for our black kitchen with a large platter, I wanted it to fit the hole in the kitchen,... so fitting our criteria, I ordered this one.  This size is great, it fits dishes that are wider than most for these external and volume dimensions (15" platter).  The power is great (1:20 for tea).  We've used the sensor cooking for veggies and potatoes with great results.The front is gloss black. I think I'd rather have a dull finish, but it easily wipes clean, so no concern.This feels like a better item than the one it replaced, so all in all that's a great start for what will likely be a long relationship...
3180	B0009KMYGY	R1VKU40NG7OKA8	Panasonic NN-H765WF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	SEEMS WELL MADE AND WORKS GREAT.	This microwave works great and the popcorn button has 3 levels depending on the size of the bag. The first level is for the standard size so you just hit the popcorn button once and then start and it comes out great. The size is nice, its not as tall as some weve had and the inside has a nice large glass platter that rotates. You can reduce the cooking power if you like. It will also keep foods warm to serve when you are ready. Its a nice micrwave for the price, easy to use and works well. The door seems light but thats fine as long as it holds up.
3181	B002VI5KPY	R2KJDKTO0KU8PO	Kenmore Black 0.7 Cu. ft. Counter Top Microwave 69079	WAY-TOO-NOISY (+_+)!	Been a Loyal Customer of Kenmore 0.7 Cu. ft. Counter Top Microwave -this is my 3RD round:Maybe because the previous ones were manufactured in the United States,the quality was to my satisfaction;however, this one, maybe because it's manufactured in China --Annoyingly WAY-TOO-NOISY, buttons are NOT as sensitive to touch, especially the START BUTTON (have to hold DOWN the unit with one hand & press hard the SB 2-3 times with the other -- INCONVENIENT);SIGNS ARE NOT CLEARLY VISIBLE -- another inconvenience.As it's COMPACT serves my need!As for the POWER USAGE, we shall see when I get the bill.I'll get adjusted to the inconveniences but the HIGH-VOLUME-NOISE of this product is something else;Hope, it gets improved in the future.

This new microwave has so many new features and is quite simple to use once you get cooking with it.  It is very nice looking and easy to keep clean.  I know I will be using it more and more as time goes on. It's a winner for me.

3184	B0009KMYHI	R1CYGGN3GO9NCI	Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	NICE!	This microwave is VERY nice and has TONS of features that we will probably never use.  The beeper is nice and not too loud, but does beep 5 times.
3185	B007TIE160	R301JVDXJKQKQM	Oster OGZB1101 1.1 Cubic Feet Digital Microwave Oven, Black	Dim display screen	The appliance works ok but the display is so dim it is difficult to read. The one I returned was worse and couldn't be read.
3186	B0009KMYHI	R12D9D7U14SKQM	Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	very nice microwve	simple to operate, quite, cooks well, easy to understand modes.

3187	B00785MYBS	R30JJEBTHHS6KK	Panasonic NN-SD762S Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel	Recommend this microwave	Very pleased with the microwave. Slightly larger than my previous oven and the extra space is great. Also very happy with the inverter feature to select true power levels.
3188	B0009KMYDM	R1HHQ41I726F7M	Panasonic NN-H965WF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Deeper heating.	This replaced a smaller unit that took two and one half min. to reheat a cup of coffee.  Do it now in One and a half min.I like the automatic time selection for many foods and amounts.
3189	B005BFZ5TU	R2P4QU17G0LIRH	Panasonic NN-SN651B Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Panasonic Microwave	Needed a countertop microwave for a new home customer and was shopping price. This was the best choice. Customer is happy.
3190	B0009KMYDW	R1U9JNCU4MUGEX	Panasonic NN-H965BF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	Very good for the price	Original item arrived improperly assembled by manufacturer.  Return and replacement went easily per Amazon procedure.  Replacement is glossy and shows smuges/fingerprints easily.  The oven performs as advertised.  Pushing a button to open the door is different, had to get used to.  That can move the oven if too vigorous.  Large size good for our purpose.  We have an opening in cabinetry which this fills nicely.
3191	B0009KMYDM	R3CUPT2LT77HVK	Panasonic NN-H965WF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Panasonic Microwave	Pros: Cooks evenly, 1250 Watts of power, large full size comportment, quick function buttons, rotating turntable.Cons: None so far.The Bottom Line: I definitely recommend this microwave becasuse of it's 1250 Watts of power and large size.
3192	B004WP0DJW	RAOIG9V0FYUFU	Kenmore Black 1.2 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave 69129	more than i bargained for	I am very impressed with the evenness of cooking and that it has a curved back inside to allow turning of large round items.
3193	B005GSZB9Q	RGJ2UPBM175YO	Whirlpool WMC20005YW 0.5 Cu. Ft. White Countertop Microwave	Just what I needed!	I ordered this corner microwave due to a very limited amount of counter space.  It fits right where I wanted it to and looks great! I have had it for a couple of weeks now and have not run across any issues.  Great purchase.  Thanks!
3194	B0009KMYDM	R1JC52VI6K9K7Q	Panasonic NN-H965WF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, White	Works fine but makes a funny noise with fan when starting and stopping.	This microwave is large and has lots of features such as sensors that tell you when the food is hot and so on.  The only thing that gives me pause is the fan makes a noise when microwave starts and stops.  My husband took of the back and looked at it to make sure something wasn't broken, but everything was fine.  It works great.  Still, the noise is of some concern.
3195	B0009KMYHI	RH0HY4BTW7BQ1	Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	A Little Disappointing	This was a slight downgrade from my last Panasonic Microwave, but I needed a slightly smaller one, and couldn't pay quite as much.  Well, you get what you pay for.  This cooks quite nicely, but the defrost and the reheat functions are by no means as good as they were on the more expensive model.  Not a bad microwave, all in all, but it was just a little disappointing after I had so loved my older one.
3196	B005BFZ5N6	R1U3JLBHUSFW07	Panasonic NN-SD681S Genius "Prestige" 1.2 cuft 1200 Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Readout, Stainless Steel	We're Not Microwave Dependent - But This Is A Good One	Easy to operate.  Authentic feel to the controls.  Wonderful to reheat coffee -- and thaw frozen meat using its sensor.  Still discovering its capabilities.  Right now my wife and I are very pleased
3197	B0009KMYHI	RMPCNL7V4LXH0	Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Black	I don't know what went wrong	I bought this oven a year back and it ran perfectly well. My wife loved the brand, but suddenly there was a pop and it stopped working. I showed it to a mechanic and he said that the magnetron and a fuse were gone. I bought another Panasonic microwave oven and that one also turned off with a pop within a month and the problem was same. The product gives very nice service, but I don't know what went wrong with my two Panasonic ovens; now I have a stockpile to dispose off. I am sad because I liked the brand and none of it worked for me.
3198	B000ON2TQG	RVYXZWM6I8JLQ	Panasonic NN-SD997S Genius "Prestige" 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Readout, Stainless Steel	Great microwave	Don't listen to those who complain about the supposed "chip" on the top of the microwave. I've owned two of these Panasonic microwaves, and they both had this. Careful examination shows that it's a divot in the door so that it swings open freely.Otherwise, this is a good product. Cooks evenly and looks nice. Would recommend!
3199	B005C2QM3U	RUFEEVFV0MC69	Nostalgia Electrics RMO-400BLK Retro Series .9 CF Microwave Oven, Black	Tacky / non-retro microwave	I purchased this oven based on the reviews, big mistake. This oven might nuke just fine but it is really cheap looking! There is plastic chrome type all over it declaring it's retro credentials, how could it be retro when there were no microwaves in this supposed time zone, think Sputnik. I will keep this short if you like cheap tacky looking things, you are going to love this product. If you do not stay far, far, another galaxy away from this.
