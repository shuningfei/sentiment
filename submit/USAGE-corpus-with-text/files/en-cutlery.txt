1050	B0016J4230	R1K7Q6HL6IFJOQ	Ginsu 7108 Chikara 8-Piece Stainless Steel Knife Set with Bamboo Block	Good Knives for the Money	These are nice knives for a 70$ knife set, but they wouldn't be worth much more than that.  Though they are made of relatively nice steel, the sides of the knives are not polished and the notches in the santoku blade are rough.  This seems to defeat the purpose of the notches in the blade because vegetables cling to the side of the blade no matter what due to the rough steel.  Eventually I'll upgrade to a high end set of Henckel or Wustof knives, but for now these knives will serve fine.
1051	B0006TJ7HM	R1BKPEA72P3HNN	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural	I seriously LOVE these knives.	I had to replace my other set because they broke and fell apart. I shopped online a while to find a good set that is not too expensive and these are great! When I compared them to the ones I'm giving away the quality is unbeatable. They are thick and very sharp not to mention they look great on my counter! The scissors could have been made better (did not like them) so I kept the ones from the other set and replaced them. I STILL gave this set 5 stars because they really are good. Another set I have had for 5 years came from IKEA and they are still going strong.. let's see how long these last.
1052	B000FZ223I	R3IDGZ0GJL2I66	Rada Cutlery Starter Set, 7 Pc Boxed Gift Set, Made in USA, Aluminum Handles (S38)	Love these knives	Bought a set of these about 10 years ago at a fund raiser for our local FD and they are still almost as sharp as they day we bought them.  Hold an edge well and I personally like that they are not so heavy.  Looking forward to many happy days of cooking with these in years to come.
1053	B000IBU9FW	R3UIA95K7TYPHS	Mercer Cutlery Genesis 6-Piece Forged Knife Block Set, Steel/Black	Better than my ja Henckels	I bought this set of knives for our house down the shore to replace the procut generic knives we inherited with the house. I have a set of ja henkel knives I got from Costco years ago that I thought were good. Before taking them down, still wrapped up I opened them to see if I made a good choice. Needless to say the Henckels got wrapped up and these stayed at home.Great weight and sharp, feel sturdy and comfortable in your hand. I cook and cut constantly and these babies are good. I have some very good knives but can definitely see these getting a lot of use.Anyone who says these are not sharp enough are insane. Unless u need a surgeons scalpel these will be plenty sharp enough to cut any food.
1054	B008GYQAMY	R1MZ2R2VHGZ8OY	Ginsu 05253 Koden Series Serrated Stainless Steel Ever Sharp 14-Piece Block Cutlery Set, Black	Awesome Gift	There were some issues when the package first arrived, 4 steak knives were missing. I simply returned that set and recieved a great set in the mail a few days later.
1055	B001E1664I	R1QQ7S3MKNOY49	Pencil Grip Gripable Comfortable Cutlery, Fork, Knife, Spoon with Gripable Handles, Blue and White Handles, TPG-640B	Great forks, decent spoons, sharp knives	My toddler was getting frustrated by plastic fork and spoon sets, so I wanted something that was safe for her but would actually allow her to spear something on a fork. To that end: the forks are perfect! My kiddo now enjoys eating with one because she's not frustrated by an ineffective plastic utensil. The spoon is perfectly ok, it's just a bit small, and the bowl is a bit shallow, so things like peas and corn fall off of it very easily, which frustrates her and then causes her to go back using her fingers. The knife is a bit too sharp for a 2 y.o. I'm guessing it'll come in handy at some later point.
1056	B0006TJ7HM	R3SCGQW35FKMRS	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural	No good!!	First of all I only recieved the knives...it was missing the block. Then...although the knives are sharp and do cut well...the first knife I used rusted after one use!! If you dont wash and dry these knives off directly after using them you probably wont have them long. Overall I would not recommend buying these.
1057	B000FA9204	R2N0FXXTHZ0EP1	J.A. Henckels International 15707-000 Fine Edge Synergy 17-Piece Knife Block Set	Great knives	So far the knives have worked great, no complaints thus far. There are extremely sharp and comfortable to use. Having the option to sharpen is also a plus.
1058	B0053KMAMI	R2Z525QCWCDG07	Clear plastic combo cutlery - 300 Count. 100 each of, spoons, forks, knives.	Beware...	This plastic silverware is very flimsy and the size is smaller than other plastic utensils.  This is not going to work for my light appetizer reception.  I'm sure it would be a challenge to fork a meatball.  I will be returning.
1059	B0016P3708	R34LEUQ7OM9RI0	Chicago Cutlery 18-Piece Insignia Steel Knife Set with Block and In-Block Sharpener	A Decent Set of Knives	The knives are sharp, and I like the built in sharpener. However, out of the box there were gouges in the blades edge that I had to remove by sharpening the knives. This was on at least three of them. Also, I have been hand washing the knives, but one of them is starting to rust already, by the handle, (2 weeks old) and the scissors have discolored along with another knife. Aside from that they work well.
1060	B0015AHQXI	R5WNVI4OQ0ZEO	International 53-Piece Simplicity Flatware Set	OK , BETTER THAN THE ONES WITH SKINNY HANDLES	THEY FIT YOUR HAND BETTER THAN SKINNY HANDLES , SO YOU CAN USE THEM WITHOUT HURTING YOUR HAND. THE OVERALL SIZE IS A MITE BIGGER , BUT THATS OK , THAT WAY I CAN SHOVEL IT IN FASTER , THEY ARE STRONG SO THEY DON'T BEND AROUND.  THERE ARE MUCH BETTER ONES OUT THERE , IF YOU WANT TO PAY MORE , BUT FOR THE PRICE THESE ARE JUST FINE.
1061	B000ASGBNM	R3VF5SUG1O3PCU	Oneida Mooncrest 45-Piece Flatware Set, Service for 8	Fabulous value for everyday use	I was looking for substantial flatware for everyday use.  I wanted something rather streamline in design.  This flatware is heavy duty, yet looks elegant.  It feels great in your hand and works very well.  The price is unbelievable.  I bought two sets, because I didn't want to have to keep reaching in my dishwasher to retrieve a fork or spoon.  Now I think I'm going to get a third set--then I'll have everything matching for those crazy family gatherings.  That way I don't have to keep the old unmatched stuff.  Those can go to my starving-artist daughter.  I read many of the previous reviews before I bought.  Most were very good reviews.  I don't understand the few real negative ones.  I really don't think you'll go wrong with this product.
1062	B0016P59NQ	R2FXPQ0IB1YP6	Chicago Cutlery Metropolitan 15-Piece Block Knife Set	A Cut Above	Well, actually, 15 cuts above anything for the kitchen I have ever owned. For the money, this set would be hard to beat.  The knife block is angled so it can be placed on the countertop under a cabinet and the knives removed. I am a hobby kitchen dude and for the casual kitchen dweller you have found what you are looking for.
1063	B0006TJ7HM	R3TDRZDL546WA1	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural	Nice Set	I really only use a couple knives from this and the scissors but it is a lovely set. I like how much space it frees up to have them neatly in the block.
1064	B001QTB71U	R1BQMZ4HDDEWEE	Fornuft Casual Flatware Silverware 20 Piece Set	Good, neat looking	I dont know what to say, i dont have to make flatware purchases ever, i know nothing of flatware...this is decent and looks good.
1065	B001TH8IJ8	R1WMBPA7YXJ1DR	Ginsu Essential Series 5-Piece Stainless Steel Knife Prep Set with Triple Riveted Full Tang Handles and Natural Hardwood Block 4852	Not Stainless Steel	This is the first negative review I've made, but need to say that these knives are NOT as advertised. They showed spots after a couple of washings! Even the cheapest grocery store purchased knives don't show spots. I tried to clean them with a scouring pad, and a gray color came washing off. Guess they were simply stainless steel coated. Don't buy these knives.
1067	B000JHGQKW	R1IT9F4CM6O8I8	Reflections Heavyweight "Looks Like Silver" Disposable Flatware for 40 with BONUS Pack of 40 Forks - 160 Pieces in All	great and sturdy	They are wonderful. comparing to the previous reviews, the forks are actually real sturdy. they are nothing compared to regular flimsy plastic utensils.i love them, and we are using them for a bridal shower.
1068	B000RY1G7A	RPI567YGFA87A	J.A. Henckels Bellasera 45-Piece Flatware Set, Service for 8	Bright & shiny & durable so far, knife issue is no problem.	Have been using since early November and love this flatware.  My dishwasher has no drying cycle which Henckels recommends, but the flatware comes out just fine. (This may be more a testament to my dishwasher's heat retention.)I have had just minor issues with balancing the knife a few times and found if I adjust how I lay it on the plate (either put more handle on the plate or set it on vertically (either blade up or down) it works, but because of the design, you can easily set the knife back on the table standing with its blade down, because the "business" part of the blade does not touch the table.To those who have rust problems not due to misuse,  have you attempted to contact Henckels re: the lifetime warranty?My only gripe with this product is that Henckels does not make this set for 12 and 23 piece sets for 4 are available at very few places including just a small percentage of Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Fortuneately my neighborhood BBB stocked the 23 piece set (not the 45 however)and even with s coupon, it was a bit priceier due to 3 serving pieces (serving spoon, meat fork and slotted spoon) which I really did not need.
1069	B001QTB71U	R1QDDC9866TGH0	Fornuft Casual Flatware Silverware 20 Piece Set	great flatware	so glad I purchased this item. I have absolutely no complaints about this product. =) will purchase again in the future if I have too
1070	B00091SCTQ	R3OS1ZHVFQR10G	Chicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition 14-Piece Block Set	Handles are junk, split and 'threading' slivers of wood	Junk. I was amazed, as I have a GREAT set of Chicago Cutlery (440A Fine series). You just cant make them better than that set...but they proved they can do the opposite. This isnt even good as a starter set, as you're never going to use them without kevlar gloves, unless you like splinters and cutting yourself from using more force to slice from the dull unsharpable blades.
1071	B00091SCTQ	R22U8AHD5DHWKV	Chicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition 14-Piece Block Set	Great set of knives	This set of knives is awesome!  I love that it contains the couple of knives I consider essential (chefs, utility and paring) AND a set of 8 steak knives all in a block!
1072	B002SR0SW8	R3L9T38FZ6ILVQ	J.A. Henckels International Forged Premio 13-Piece Block Set	Sketchy Advertising	The set I found elsewhere (since I believe in handling my potential purchases so I can read what the label actually says) uses German steel.  The knives are assembled in Spain, the block and sharpening post made in China and the scissors made in Japan.  The set I describe is also advertised as the "International" set.It seems vendors are starting to get a touch elusive about how they present where their products (or more specifically, ALL of their product) are being made.
1073	B0006TJ7HM	R2ZVU8P6FQPBIJ	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural	This is not what I received	This product seems fine so far, but the knife block that I received is black and the knives do not say ginsu on them, nor does the block. I'm not entirely sure how this happened, but this is not the product I ordered. Obviously, they do the same general thing, but they are not ginsu knives.
1074	B002OB49DW	R2414NIYNVNKOY	Present time Mix and Match Mutlicolored Assorted Cutlery Set, 16-Piece	Fun purchase!	I absolutely love this cutlery set. I've been hand washing them and haven't had any problems so far. I was a little disappointed because I received two bamboo handle teaspoons instead of one being the pink and yellow polkadot teaspoon. I am sure I could have exchanged them for another set, but in the end they are just spoons.
1075	B001692XPE	RQB8NRQUL397U	Rada Cutlery Quick Edge Knife Sharpener with Hardened Steel Wheels (Designed for Rada Knives), R119	THE BEST GADGET EVER!!!	My dad gave me some Rada knives over 25 years ago since he swore by them and they are all going strong still and I have added some also over the years and I've used nothing but this little sharpener on them to maintain a razor sharp edge. I have many other knives too and after every use make a few passes through it to hone the edge perfectly. Very dull knives should be run through a carbide type sharpener first and then finished with the Rada for best results..
1076	B000FSC9MY	RM8ALLGPM059T	Oneida Tuscany 20-Piece Flatware Set, Service for 4	A Classic Style	I purchased the larger size setOneida Tuscany 45-Piece Flatware Set, Service for 8, then decided to add an additional 4 place settings...very happy with my decision.  I love the classic styling of this set and the weight came as a pleasant surprise.  I look forward to using this set of flatware for years to come!
1077	B001QTB71U	R1X0C0KMBWVCXG	Fornuft Casual Flatware Silverware 20 Piece Set	Perfect price. Perfect Flatware.	I somehow manage to lose all my cutlery. I can go about 6 months before I can't find a fork or a spoon (the knives are usually the last to disappear). So when I saw this cute, simple set I had to pick it up. I'm really glad I did. I love the smaller spoon and smaller fork. They work well and have a nice size and texture. Worked out very well...though out of 20 I'm already down to 16. Gotta stop taking spoons and knives to work!!
1078	B003IKMSG8	RDS3ONT2A0P9S	Cook N Home 15 Piece Cutlery set, Wooden Block	Good qualty	Good qualityand very nice to use, my mother very happy when she used itthank you very muchbyer
1079	B0006TJ7HM	R3GD6L2WJ2ZK2D	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural	Excellent value	For under thirty dollars, you cannot go wrong.  The blades really live up to the cliche "Sharp as a razor."  The wood block looks very nice too.  Perfect cutlery set for the occasional cook in the house but I suspect the more frequent chiefs might prefer a heavier duty set.
1080	B0006TJ7HM	R1W0VHPHH7Y0WR	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural	Read This Before You Buy	I cannot believe anyone doesn't know the history of these knives.  They started out being advertised on TV in 1978 by a guy who just died.  A total shame, not stainless steel, pure junk.  Google Ginsu Knives before you go further.  So damn funny.
1081	B0016J4230	RVTGBGAG96V9C	Ginsu 7108 Chikara 8-Piece Stainless Steel Knife Set with Bamboo Block	Ginsu Chikara nives	This is an eight peice set which includes the bamboo stand, scissors and a shapening rod as well. These knives were reviewed in a leading consumer magazine and were highly recommended. The knives surely are very sharp. I ran one gently over my thumb and although it did not draw blood, it did cut my thumb! They are all very well balanced. I think for our pruposes they would do spelndidly. We are vegetrians and it is going to be a pleasure cutting vegetables with this set of knives. Although I was initially skeptical about the scissors, even they may be useful. I have not had a need to use the shapening rod yet.
1082	B000117C72	R3M54QTKSHG21E	Chicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition 3-Piece Prep Knife Gift Set	Not what I was hoping for!	Bought this set so that I could use it on Thanksgiving but realized after cutting up my turkey for left overs that the larger knife ended up having ridges on the blade from bending. Not sure why since I was not chopping up the bones of the turkey only the meat. Now I have this knife which I only used once and I am unable to use it again! :-(
1083	B0016J4230	RPOKHSMWVRV4	Ginsu 7108 Chikara 8-Piece Stainless Steel Knife Set with Bamboo Block	You get what you pay for	Read many reviews before buying this product (including Consumer Reports flawed high rating) and now, after using it, I am quite amazed of the overly positive writings this has received.POSITIVES - Knives are well balanced, not very heavy, blades are sharp (although they need to be honed every time after being used to keep them sharp), bamboo quality/finish/look is great, and product carries mfr's limited life warranty!NEGATIVES - There is a lot to say..... upon first visual contact one can easily tell this is NOT a Japanese-made product (I erroneously assumed so! - and it sure 'screams volumes' to the fact it is a Chinese-made, inferior quality product). The maximum thickness of the blade(not the cutting edge) is thicker than a traditional, quality Japanese knife (such as the Sandoku) and that alone plays a major role in the QUALITY of cutting (the thinner the blade, past the cutting edge, a more precise cut is attained and thus the higher the quality of the cut).I used a high magnification microscope to examine eveness/smoothness of the blade's cutting edge and was amazed at the plethora of not only imperfections but also extensive 'chipping' which definately leaves the edge uneven and has a negative effect on the quality of cuts.In the past I have examined other Japanese-style chef knives and could barely detect any such adverse characteristics - the difference of course on those knives is their much higher pricing (about 5 to 1 ratio) than the pricing of the Ginsu knives. There are other adverse quality issues that I would like to mention but I will sound too technical and thus I will pass.Overall, for the average consumer (like myself), there is another annoying trait of the Ginsu knives - they are HORRIBLE with stains (very-very prone to stains). Although the blades are made of stainless steel you will just be amazed how easily and quickly these blades scratch and stain. I think the mfr should describe the blades' material (and in capital letters) as being "highly-stained steel"). After 3 separate uses of the knives, at different times, the knives were quickly washed with warm water and soap and dried at once. But even such will not prevent the abhorring staining... very easily seen all ovel the metal surfaces of the blades. It is unbeleivably HORRIBLE! Is it because of the type of steel used?, the forging process?, metal treatment?, or whatever else may be, I do not know. What I know for sure, in no time these blades will have stains all over (if not rust).I sure do not want rust and such crappy look on my chicken counter.Last, but not least, the resin knife-handles look 'foggy' no matter how you wash or dry them - they do look old and smudgy and thus do not add to one's kitchen overall look. Perhaps they will balance out well in a garage's or tool-shed's environment.All in all, I would not recommend this product for one's kitchen functional and decorative oblectives. Last, the company lies when it says the blade stays sharp for a long time. That is just not true with this product. After less than 30 minutes of cutting you will be able to tell that the knife has become dull.CONCLUSION : In search of great Japanese-style knives (and there are many but way more expensive) if you choose the Ginsu Chikara (chinese-made) knives you just get exactly what you pay for (inferior product for less $$). Consumer Reports magazine should be ashamed of yourselves in 'manufacturing' and presenting cooked-up (I am sure for profit) information to your subscribers!
1084	B0016J4230	R1OGVG0PE414IO	Ginsu 7108 Chikara 8-Piece Stainless Steel Knife Set with Bamboo Block	Ginsu Chikara Knife Set	This is a very nice knife set for the price.  I certainly could have found other sets for a lot more money, but this set meets my needs very well.  The block is of good quality and looks very nice on my kitchen counter.
1085	B001UBLVCY	R2FV955ZGBOLTO	Crystal Clear Cutlery 360 Pieces (180 Forks - 120 Spoons - 60 Knives)	Great	These were what I needed in terms of how many I get...I only wish I could get a box of just forks.  I probalby will never use all the knives
1086	B000FA9204	R2LNPT3TF7PLGT	J.A. Henckels International 15707-000 Fine Edge Synergy 17-Piece Knife Block Set	Great if you like RUSTY knives	These knives cut okay, not great, but okay. They are not the sharpest knives, but I have used worse. The biggest problem is that I bought them about a year and a half ago and they pretty much started rusting immediately. Every single knife has rust on it and I just couldn't stand it any longer so I bought replacements (Wusthof...worth the $$$).These are not Henckels knives made in Germany, these are a cheaper version made in China - if you are buying for the name...save yourself the hassle and your money.
1087	B0015AHQXI	R1EE6SUPDZG5Q6	International 53-Piece Simplicity Flatware Set	Awsome!	I love this flatware set.The best value out there and the best price!heavy duty metal too.
1088	B0006TJ7HM	R37YP77CWGETTR	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural	Sharp!	These knives are well worth the money.Watch out though..very sharp. I ended up in ER for slicing my finger whilst trying to take them out of their packaging!
1089	B0016P3708	R1WSSP3VSE3UHM	Chicago Cutlery 18-Piece Insignia Steel Knife Set with Block and In-Block Sharpener	Great product at a reasonable price	Chicago Cutlery quality and the in-block sharpener works very nicely.  Now our knives are always sharp.  Coming up on a year and the knives still look brand new.
1090	B0006TJ7HM	R1C9I4XT9JIB5B	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural	Best bang for the buck!	I simply can not believe how great this set is for so little money?Super sharp, well balanced, attractive, seemingly great quality...How do they do it?
1091	B0006TJ7HM	R248TF77GTK2O1	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural	Worst knives ever...seriously	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural are the biggest pieces of crap I have ever seen. I read the reviews before ordering and most people favor these knives. Not me. I knew they were cheap but I was hoping that they would slice better than my mid range current knives. Nope. I literally used every knife in the block in the past two days and each experience was awful. The worst part...I decided that since I bought new knives I wouldn't wash them in the dishwasher. So I placed them in the sink to handwash. Two days of sitting in the sink with other dirty dishes (don't judge)they had already rusted. I am not even kidding you. Rusted. It wasn't like they were soaking in water they were simply in the sink with other dishes that I intended to wash by hand. These are going back. They are crap. Don't waste your time or your money on these. Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural
1092	B0011TRO80	RPFA9IIHVZWQT	Ginsu 7112 Chikara 12-Piece Stainless Steel Cutlery Set with Bamboo Block	Not as impressed as others .... returned	I didn't find that these knives were nearly as sharp as I'd expected. If this is what passes as sharp, then I'll hold out for knives that never need sharpening. I've returned these, but not yet replaced them with a different set.
1093	B0011TRO80	R3DUAHHBKJ0T2C	Ginsu 7112 Chikara 12-Piece Stainless Steel Cutlery Set with Bamboo Block	great product	The Chikara knife set is a quality product and you can't beat the price.Would recomend to any one.
1094	B0006TJ7HM	R15GBKXPGQS4KO	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural	Great Starter Knife Set	This knife set is wonderful! The knives were sharp right out of the box, and we've been using them for four months with no discernible difference in their cutting ability. I hate to hand-wash dishes, but these definitely should be washed by hand for two reasons. First, the handles become slightly faded from the dishwasher detergent, and second, the knives come clean but usually have several water spots on the blades that look rusty. I would definitely recommend these to anyone. I'm actually buying two sets as Christmas presents right now.
1095	B0006TJ7HM	R1WH2KKDEACVL8	Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural	Great knives!!	These are some really good knives for the money!! They are really worth the money, you want regret buying these!!
1096	B000JHGQKW	R23HLZTW7HRJAJ	Reflections Heavyweight "Looks Like Silver" Disposable Flatware for 40 with BONUS Pack of 40 Forks - 160 Pieces in All	for outdoor wedding	I looked high and low for quality disposable flatware, these did the trick.  I will most definitely order these again.
1097	B003IKMSG8	R1AGHPO7GSTYTJ	Cook N Home 15 Piece Cutlery set, Wooden Block	Inexpense but well crafted	The block and knives are well constructed.  Will reccommend to others.  The price was fair and much lower than the local stores.  Win win for me.
1098	B004WNGKF0	R3AX5S9EFFPSHL	United Cutlery UC2724 Combat Commander Mini Boot Knife, Black Partially Serrated	Almost perfect	Size, weight, construction & appearance are all outstanding. My only complaint is the edge. The serrated portion of the blade is sharp but the straight edge was marginal at best, and bringing it up to a satisfactory sharpness has proven a great deal of work. Despite this pain in the a**, I would recommend.
1099	B002SR0SW8	R31OZH1IOKZFZC	J.A. Henckels International Forged Premio 13-Piece Block Set	Bread knife broke in half while cutting butter..yes butter	I bought my set back in april 2012, its oct 2012 now and when using the rigged blade bread knife of the set today, it broke while tryin to cut thru butter to put on a bagel, yes cool butter from the refrigerator, blade broke right in half. My last Farberware set made it longer than this. This is embarassing would never buy this international chinese junk again. only descent henkels come from germany, these international ones are garbage. Plenty of brown spotting on the blades too coming out of the dishwasher and there suppose to be stainless,,lol. dont buy. tried returning but its out of warranty,,serious junk,,stay away.
